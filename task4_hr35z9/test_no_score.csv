Give it time,"If you are looking for another Murmer, look somewhere else. Like Murmer, the album is atmospheric. But this one extends REM's progression from New Adventures in Hi-Fi with more soundscapes and layered guitars and keyboards, though many of the songs are instantly accessible, like Lotus. The band is getting older and I guess less inclined to rock out. The highlight for me is the final song, ""Fall to Climb,"" an anguished coda with Michael Stipe lashing out and pitying himself at the same time to a haunting melody that has REM stamped all over it. But as they are now superstars with no motive to make any more money, REM uses up its alloted time with its share of weak spots. But, of course, the good far outweighs the bad. Docked a star for its length. Up sounds like a collection of experiments, promonged by the 70+ minute CD format."
"Useless, with the exception of checking your email.","As others have stated, this device is USB 1.1, which makes it extraordinarily slow. I bought this since my daughter stuck a pencil in the ethernet port on my notebook. I usually use wireless so this isnt too much of a problem. However, I needed to transfer about 400-500 gigabytes of media to a NAS (Network Storage). I figured it would be more stable, and also quicker to go over wires. I was shocked to see the maximum speed it would transfer with this device is around 300-400kb per second, compared to about 10mb per second with an onboard NICWhat year is this again, 1999? Are USB 2.0 chipsets really that much more expensive for the manufacturer? Not to mention the lack of available information on this from Amazons description."
The Album That Started It All For Martina...,"Still one of my favorite Martina albums.This is classic Martina!Although this isn't her first album(it's her second) she only started producing hits since this second album, after releasing her famous domestic abuse hit Independence Day, which after 16 years is still her signature song and what a powerful song it is too!!Also other stand outs are the touching ballads That Wasn't Me,her hit Where I Used To Have A Heart(love this song),She Ain't Seen Nothing Yet and Strangers(her vocals are amazing on this). However, there's also some cracking uptempo toe - tapping gems like her hits Life #9,Heart Trouble and My Baby Loves Me.You can never go wrong with a Martina McBride album.You will not be disappointed with this little gem!!"
Not up to some other versions,"This production of the classic was just okay. I have seen other versions which flowed more smoothly. Also, it appeared as though the production was done on a shoe string budget. The settings were barren and some actually appeared to be in ruins. While this may have been done for artistic reasons, it distracted from the story."
Great CD,This cd has a good selection of Prince great hits. I have really enjoyed this cd and would recommend any Prince fan to buy it.
Cindy,"When I first bought this mix for my husband who has celiac disease, I only made pancakes. Then I bought a Cuisinart waffle maker and tried the waffle recipe on the bag - spectacular! We went camping with our adult children and grandkids who have no dietary restrictions, and I could not make the waffles fast enough. There is also a carrot cake recipe on the bag that I use to make carrot muffins, and then freeze them. My husband can have a carrot muffin with his coffee anytime he wants a snack. It is wonderful to have such a good versatile product on the shelf for anyone - whether they suffer from celiac disease or not. Buying from Amazon make the work of difference to know that you can always get that specialized product delivered to your door with free shipping. Thanks Pamela and Thanks Amazon!!!"
where'd the creativity go?,"This album is a big disappointment. Their self titled album caught me by surprise- i liked ""Sugar"" and was really shocked to hear that the rest of the album was just as good and better in some places. They had catchy guitar work,crunchy rythms and those intense vocals. Now the lyrics are just annoying with simple phrases screamed over and over. There's no melody in these songs, and the guitar is nowhere near where it was on the last album. The last album was so much more creative. Toxicity sounds like what you'd get if you asked some teenage SOAD tribute band to make some new songs. What happened?"
Wonderful Indeed,When I was a little boy I got this set for Christmas one year...and I'm glad to see this amazing set is still available for fans of Oz to enough still!! It's very simple indeed--just cut and glue each character together.! Many famous Oz characters are included to inhabit this 3-D Emerald City...fans of the books will definately recognize each one! A definate treat!
The Cat Who Sang For The Birds has hit a wrong note.,"This current book of MS Braun's is different from her past works. This endeavor has a different feel to it. There is a dark and brooding mood. Gone are the older characters that imparted the charming small town feeling. The bantering between Polly and Quill is missing, as are the cats. Though they do make an appreance, most of the cat in The CAT Who.. is absent. Gone also, is the humor. If you had to skip one book in the series, this would be the one. It does not continue the story line in the old familary way. Reread one of the first three books, and wait for the next one."
Very well made,"Even though this NIKON remote cord costs more than double what a generic cord costs, it is well worth the difference. It is well made, sturdy, will not give me problems with the electrical connections, and I am confident that the hot shoe connection will not suddenly come apart- at the worst possible moment."
"Spiritless, Pointless, Meaningless","This is a book of vacuous characters who do nothing. The plot goes nowhere while it follows Holly Golightly everywhere. While engaging in an endless round of socializing, she fails to endear herself in any way. I would certainly not waste my life chasing this shallow bimbo. The film version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" must have been a success because the entire script was rewritten to include only the original title. I give this book 1 star only because it was so mercifully short."
Takes Hours to Filter,"I bought the Pur pitcher, followed the instructions to prepare it, but it takes FOREVER to filter.There's something wrong with this filter design. I have a friend with the same pitcher and the same problem. You can fill the pitcher to the top and it will still be 95% unfiltered hours later. We live in NYC and the water is not abnormally dirty, .I've used Brita filters before this and it filtered fine, much faster. I will be going back to Brita filters."
NO MORE INTRUSIVE AND CRAPPY DRMS PLEASE,"I am VERY interested in this game and was about to get it until I read the reviews. I'm not going to buy this and any other that comes with crappy and problematic kinds of drm, the funny part with this is that it just makes people run away and get pirated and cracked copies instead.That's all I wanted to say."
A terrific sequel to a terrific book.,"""Beggars and Choosers"" is the sequel to the fascinating book ""Beggars in Spain"". It is every bit as good as ""Beggars in Spain"", and presents a plausible yet fantastic set of subsequent events. Like ""Beggars in Spain"", the characterization is as good as the plot, and a variety of political and science themes are explored.My only reservation about this book is that I would recommend reading ""Beggars in Spain"" first."
Outstanding pruners,"I work in a vineyard for a living, and these are the pruners I choose to use every day. The ergonomic handle is outstanding and the quality of the pruners is wonderful. I've used a lot of pruners over the years, but I suspect this will be the last pair I ever buy."
Face cream,I did not like this cream at all. It was very greasy and made mebreak out. It also seems to have quite a bit ofperfume in it so it also burned. My face is very sensitiveand this was not what a good product for a person who havefrequent facials etc...
Japanese Samurai Cinema at it's best!,"Those of you who remember a movie that was released in the states in the late 70's or 1980 called ""Shogun Assassin"" will have every reason to pick up this episode of the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Basically 80% of the bloodfest that was the movie ""Shogun Assassin"" was taken from this particular episode of Lone Wolf and Cub, Baby Cart at the River Styx. Even with subtitles this movie is still one of my all-time favorites. For years and years I had looked for the movie ""Shogun Assassin"" in video stores. When I finally found out that it was actually a part of a series called Lone Wolf and Cub, I went into a frenzy. When I finally put this gem into my VCR, I sat back with a deep sigh of relief, and watched with the same awe and amazement that I had the first time I saw this movie when I was 13 years old. It is a must buy for anyone who loves their Japanese Samurai movies with blood, gore, and believe or not, heart."
Wimpy Book.,Wimpy herion that never made me believe she was in love with Jonathan. I never felt the connection between these two. Kara was just to undecided of which man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. If you like I/R stories like me than read one of Judith Smith-Levin books or Seressia Glass. So much better than this one.
Round Robin,The book it's self was ok -- the book was a great read loved it -- will save it to loan to quilting friends or new quilters
This is gonna rock!,"As soon as I saw Top Gun: Combat Zones I thought to myself ""I have to get it"". I used to enjoy playing the Top Gun game for the original NES, and this game looks fifty times more fun. You can fly eight different planes, from the classic F-14 Tomcat to the exotic V-22 Osprey, to the old-but-true F-4 Phantom. You can fly in various campaigns from the Arctic from the Gulf (you know which one) to South East Asia. Unfortunately, this game has no two-player mode as far as I could find. Half the fun of combat flight games is dogfighting human opponents (Incase you were wondering, the other half is a mixture of good graphics and fun gameplay). If it were not for this minor fault, I would've rated it five stars. Otherwise, it looks like this game is gonna ROCK! Definitely something gamers should buy."
Why I like this album,"OK, it's not the original, and it's nowhere near as great as Pinkerton (their best album to date), but it's nice to see that Weezer is back and having fun. This isn't a fantastic album, but it's not at all bad. It just sounds like they were having a good time recording it. Welcome back, guys!"
A riveting read!,"This is a book I couldn't put down! Great characters, great plot,great pacing-- this book has it all. Do yourself a favor and buy it today!"
Great messenger bag!!!,Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
Strap and Oiler,"This is a copy of the original strap with the oiler which holds the strap into the butt of the gun. It does not come with any explanation so figuring out the oiler placement can be a bit of a challenge. As a copy of a military strap this is no frills. For actual field use a modern strap is much more comfortable, but for shows this one will do the trick."
Granddaugther Loves This Walker,"I was looking for a walker for my youngest granddaughter and stumbled upon reviews for the Little Tikes Push and Ride Doll Walker. My daughter-in-law didn't want anything that would scratch the wooden floors, so I bought colored pink duck tape and cut it to fit around the wheels. That seems to have taken care of the potential for the plastic wheels to scratch. (I am sure others reading this review could think up other methods to cover the wheels.) As far as I can tell, that is the only drawback to this walker.It was not difficult to put this together, and everything seemed to line up well.My granddaughter was barely 11 months when she received this for Christmas, but she loved it right away. She is nearly 17 months now and still rides on it.It does MOVE across the floor, so a spotter is a wise idea until the child is walking well."
We'll See...,"Very disappointed when my niece, who just graduated nursing college, opened this for Christmas and it didn't work! I was heartbroken. Thought maybe it was just a bad battery that came in it, so searched everywhere for the right-size battery and could not find one anywhere. Had to order batteries from Amazon, when they came, the clipboard still didn't work. Returned it and ordered another one because it received such good reviews, figured the first one must have been a dud. The second one works perfectly so far, but time will tell if this is really a quality product!"
Editing is Lacking an otherwise impressive story idea,Loved the content but found the style of writing to be better suited to essays. This booked seems like it was rushed to print before Preston had come up with a suitable way to tell this story. When it gets to the part where he is involved directly with the characters it is more coherent but the chapters that tell the story of each character is better as a stand alone essay. It just seems like a book that is half baked....not crazy...just not ready. Where was the editor?
Cobb Grill Just OK,"I was disappointed because I could not get the grill to cook a whole chicken up to 170 degrees. After 2 Hours I gave up and put it in the oven.I think if you want to use the grill as an oven, it works OK. But, if you have multiple Items (Like more skewers than can fit on at one time) that require you to open and Close the lid, it will not retain the heat to cook thoroughly.I sent it back!"
Secret,This is very well written and the story flows.It is a new take on what it means to be Superman.
"The ""pre-flash"" is extremely annoying. Otherwise it's fun.","The camera has a ""pre-flash"" before the real flash. which adds a full second between the instant you press the button and the time the picture is actually taken.That might not sound like much, but it's enough for you to miss that cute pose your kid HAD, a second ago... when you actually wanted the picture. You can get a kid to look at the camera for a split second, then the first flash pops, one full second later, the picture actually takes. Meanwhile your kid is a blur in the lens.It's not a ""red-eye reduction"" flash, altought the camera has that feature (even longer pause between 2 flashes). And it can't be turned off, short of turning off the flash altogether.Either I need a camera that takes the picture closer to when the button is pressed, or I need more patient kids."
Slanty eyes tell lies racist cover art means no sale to me.,"""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is a common saying, but what if the cover itself is racist? The title ""Slanted Truths"" implies that an expose of perfidy awaits the reader, while the face of a South East Asian statue indicates the race of the perpetrators.Until the cover art is changed I will not buy this book and I urge others to do likewise."
Great Arlo album,"I personally enjoyed this album of Arlo's and so did every body else in my family. And of course it has Arlo's incredible version of ""City Of New Orleans."" I recommend it!"
"Sebadoh goes mainstream, but it doesn't totally suck.","The Sebadoh was my first Sebadoh album. Since then, I have bought more in this order: Bakesale, Bubble & Scrape, Sebadoh III, and Harmacy. It was strange going backwards in time. At first, I thought The Sebadoh was really good. I played it constantly. But after buying the older stuff, I see just how great they used to be. They were more interesting and had more range, even though Eric was an oddball. It's impossible to match Bakesale's energy or Bubble & Scrapes variety. The Sebadoh is good. I loved most of Jason's songs, but Lou's songs seem pretty tame and dull now. Does he really FEEL anything anymore or is he just cranking songs out?"
Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte,"Love this movie, but ordered for a friend who loves it even more!!! It's a classic!"
fun accessory,"the construction is so so.the wires are very thin and the relay box heats up very quickly,although nothing has gone wrong with the kit sp far."
This is no Mystery Train,"Marcus has written a BOOK, and entire BOOK for heavens sake, on a collection of songs. He goes on for pages and pages, dissecting songs that Dylan probably wrote in minutes. Searching for the meaning of life in a song like 'Lo and Behold' is fruitless, I can assure you.Read Mystery Train again if you need a dose of Marcus."
Second author,I have a basic distrust of a writer using hsi/her name to seel a book I think was written primarily by someone else.
We love all the Anne Stories,All the Anne books are amazing. We liked Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea slightly better then this one but we also enjoyed this book. I would recommend it.
One of his favorites!,"Out of all of the different bones and treats we've given our dog, these are one of his all time favorites!"
Not a good Fantasy,"What is it with this movie? It has the potential to be a great movie because of the caliber of actors and the great scenery, but the plot is too slow for an adult. In fact, a child would really love it except for the fact that there's a demon on it that would scare the Heck out of them and give them nightmares for a week! I was expecting a much better movie."
"A Good Film, But.................","Yes, it is a very well-made film with a good story, strong cast and production value.Yes, it may be George Clooney's best performance in a film so far.But............. this film does not stay with you.Would this be enough for the Best Picture Oscar?"
SOTY!!!! HELL YEAH PPL \m/,"I first came across this band while playing Need For Speed Underground (strange or what!!!) I then downloaded some of their songs from kazza, and i loved them, they sound so... cool, with the fast tempo and cool beats. I dont have a favourite... well i suppose 'Burning Years' is because of its superb intro and just rockin throughout. I bought the album after weeks of saving money, and when the day came i took my walkman with me to play it straight away lol. This CD kicks ass... but Linkin Park are my fav band, they are just the best!!! U cannot match them, every so often i change my mind on wat my fav song is cos they are all soooo great!!! At the moment its 'Forgotten' (track 10, Hybrid Theory) (u know it ppl). Even the reanimation CD kicks ass 'Krwling' is the best on that album followed by 'With You' ( hearing Chester screaming at the beginning!!!)Peace out ppl!!!!"
Very Good,"I was a little worried when I got this CD because I figured it would be like every other CD and band where you hear a song that you really like, but the rest of the CD was crap. When I listened to the entire CD I realized how wrong I was. I like a majority of all the songs on here. It is a CD that you can listen to at anytime and still love it. The more I listened to it, the more I noticed that I liked the CD even more. If you like just one song on the CD, you will love the rest. It has become my favorite CD and that has a song for any kind of mood you are in."
Wristband is NOT for a woman's wrist,I love Freestyle watches but this wristband is HUGE......not made for an average size woman. I'm not talking about the width is the band. I can slide this off my wrist when it's closed......so don't order this watch unless you want to replace the band before you get this watch......I am totally disappointed in this watch.
Buttons Stop Working. Stay Away.,"Like many others, some of my buttons stopped working after about a year.I've been using calculators, cell phones, touch-tone phones, computers, etc. for years. 99.9999% of the buttons on those devices worked flawlessly through the products' long life. That's why the fact that the buttons on this remote just stop working after a short period of time (rendering the device useless) is incredible annoying. And the fact that Logitech won't stand behind its products, or the problem on future versions, is just offensive.It's too bad, because I really liked this remote while it was working.I will never buy a Logitech product with buttons until it has been on the market long enough for guinea pigs to determine the longevity of the buttons.If you don't believe me, search ""Logitech Harmony buttons stop working."""
Basic Info,"The Quaker Parrot: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy PetThis is good introductory info if you don't already own a Quaker and don't know anything abour parrots, but I strongly disagree with her method of ""potty training"". I feel this technique could have very dire consequences. I own a Quaker and found this book lacks the discription of these amazing birds, and the information is too basic for me. So, if you already own a Quaker or other parrot, I suggest you read ""Guide To The Quaker Parrot"", by Mattie Sue Athan."
Hands down one of his best!,"I've been on a tear of P.J. O'Rourke's books lately, starting with Republican Party Reptile and so forth. This is by far one of P.J.'s best. I'm on the other side of the coin politically (fairly liberal) myself, but P.J. usually spares no one, and I admire that (Rush and his wacko friends could learn a thing or two).This book is just about how to get by if you're a bachelor. It's incredibly funny for the most part (the cooking sections should not be read if you've just ate!). This is a fantastic little book, very helpful if you plan to live like a slob or like a typical college freshman."
Geoff look,"""Oman Ra"", by Victor Pelevin engages it's readers with anecdotes exploiting the lack of sophistication on projects related to the Soviet space program. I reccommend this book for many reasons. This book is beautifully written and it flows with excellent word usage that consists of many layers. Pelevin also creates an eerie sense of humor(dark humor). Dark humor is shown when Henry Kissenger visits Russia. The Russians, who want to leave a good impression on the U.S show Kissenger (an american), their hunting skills. With no game to hunt, the Russians dressed a small boy up as a bear and killed him as if a he was an animal. The book is also exciting and compelling. This is shown through Oman's different paths he chooses to take. I recommend ""Oman Ra"" to anyone who seeks a different wild and inventive story."
Digital Restore?,"I purchased the colorized set, I think a lot of time and care went into making the set look as if it was originally done in color. My only critisim so far is, during the first episode, there is a scratch line that goes right down the middle of the screen. I think that these should have been digitally restored, much like the I Love Lucy episodes. I realize the original I Love Lucy's were done in 16MM and these were probably not but more care could have been taken into touch up. Still, the color ones are the ones to opt for, even if you are a die hard TV fan, the color was done very well."
Not what I expected,"After reading a couple of glowing reviews I expected to be impressed with the quality of this toaster oven. I wanted something mainly for toasting. This oven has a setting for toast, but it doesn't work. Each time, it changes the length of cooking and the temperature seems to vary. Sometimes I get toast, sometimes bread that has just been heated a little and sometimes toast that is too dark and very hard. Even if I try to change the time, I press the start button and the timing switches to some off the wall number. I know there is a malfunctioning of the digital timer, but it's so much trouble to ship it back, it's hardly worth it. In the future, I will purchase items like this locally where I can return them when they don't work properly.It's a nice looking unit. Also, it seems to work ok with the broiler. Just not with the toast setting."
"Not a Pulitzer, but I enjoyed it.","It will not win a Pulitzer, but the story is compelling. I think the author writes from the heart. How else can you express so much disappointment and exasperation? And yet it's a feel good sort of novel ... makes you feel better that all that drama happened to someone else ... until the end, of course."
Beauty and the Beast,"The dvd looked like it was a generic copy (the pictures on the cover and on the dvd looked like they were printed off of a home computer), but the dvd plays fine so I kept it. However, I'm not convinced that this is a genuine dvd that was distributed by Disney."
Best Cowboy Music,"I was driving on a trip out West and bought this CD at Mount Rushmore. What a pleasant surprise. We played it over and over because the music is so well done with different instruments used on each song. Easy listening and brings one to a place of remembering the ""good old days"" of the West. Love, love, love it. Wish there was a volumn 2."
Constant clicking,"I registered for this monitor for my shower and was so excited to get it. My daughter (four months old) absolutely loves to watch the lights. I don't use the music, I play a classical music cd instead. However, the monitor part of it is HORRIBLE!! Our bedroom is only three feet from my daughter's and I cannot hear through the monitor. There is a constant clicking sound and a high-pitched buzzing. When my daughter does make a noise, I can't even hear it through the monitor because of the loud clicking. We haven't used this since we received it (as a montior), just as a light show. I would definitely recommend buying a different monitor and then buy one of those new &quot;light show&quot; toys that are available from many different companies."
Not the right picture,"Just a note, to indicate that we twice recieved a set that is all red with speckles, not white with red edges. Amazon really tried but they don't seem to have what is pictured."
Works for cat food,I use this to store dry cat food and it stays locked if I keep the handle upright. I needed something that my six cats couldn't open since they were always opening the cupboards in the kitchen. They are able to open the can with the handle down so I need to remember to put it back up every time I close it.
Meh. Not really worth the time.,"This is a story about a kangaroo who needs to find a way to carry her joey. After asking around and finding other people's methods don't work, she goes to the city where she gets an apron with TONS of pockets, and everybody is happy, etc. etc. etc.It's not a bad book, per se... it's just that I find it really weird that the animals listed here are not found together in nature. It's one thing to have predators speaking to prey, that happens in picture books all the time, but to have African animals talking to Australian animals, and to have Woodland animals conversing with Savannah animals? It's a little weird, is all.And the book is a bit wordy, a bit too long for the story it's telling. It's not really *all* that interesting."
The Sagan Diary,I was just surprised by the length - really short. Perhaps I should look at lengths of books - I wasn't expecting a short story.....
nv audio biblia(spanish version),cd did not work. they work for little then they do not work. bed buy and i can not rich not one to return the product.
Waste of money,I've used PUR faucet water filtration systems for more than 10 years. The first unit lasted several years and was great! I've raved over how great it is to be able to just have the unit right on your faucet. Over the years the units have deteriorated in quality to the point where the last three units didn't through 2 filters (I've tried different models). I've had this model for less than a month and it is squirting water all over my kitchen - it hasn't even made it through one filter. I won't buy a PUR product again.The filters are still great.I'm going to try the Culligan faucet mounted unit - I'm seeing great reviews for it.
No!!!! Look away,"No don't even look at this. If you are thinking about buying this i wish you the best of ""luck"" while you go on an adventure that will change your life 4ever.Leprechaun is pretty well ok movie, it trys to scare you. The rest of the movies are just pieces of crap. It goes from Crap 2 The biggest piece of crap you will ever witness in your life.C'mon a Leprechaun in space. Now, if that isn't stupid i don't know what is, and how he gets there still amazes me. How does he get in the space shuttle? A space Marine pisses on his leg, which from that piss travels into the marine and later pops out of his crotch during intercourse. Wow!!! i'll just leave it at that . WOW!!!!!"
Above average fantasy novel,"For a fantasy novel this is definitely a cut above average: it moves forward at a brisk pace, despite multiple story lines. Also better written than the first part of the series, which apparently was meant merely to provide a contrast to this book.However in many ways this is a very pessimistic book. The ""hero"" N'Doch is an all too common and quite recognisable product of the unrestrained breeding programs that Churches implement in Third World countries. In the book he is intimately exposed to enormous and magical goodness but stays ""bad to the bone"". How are we expected to survive with millions of such guys in existence and not a dragon in sight?"
it just stopped working,"It just stopped working after like 2 years. My previous camera was my father's, that he used for like 20 years. No problems for him or me.I don't believe cameras should just stop working after 2 years. From looking online it seems it is a common problem but people just expect electronics to have the quality of cars made by GM in the 1970s. Sorry I expect things to work and not just for a short while."
false advertising,This isn't the product you get.....the greenhouse isn't 10' tall it's 6' and it isn't the metalic color shown in the pic.......it's green and it doesn't have a decorative trianglular top.......the real one doesn't even have a top. It doesn't weigh near what they show on here and it looks cheap and flimsy. I have already contacted ace and amazon. I don't want to pay the return shipping. Fair warning.......it's not worth the price
We Love It!,"A wooden, portable activity arch is a wonderful baby toy! So many activity mats sold in the US are so bright and busy they totally overstimulate a baby. This is a beautiful, well-made arch. All of the toys are detachable, so you can introduce one at a time. Also, you can remove the plush toys and hang other grasping toys. My 3 month old son loves the arch. His favorite thing to grasp right now is one of those plastic ""Live Strong"" bracelets suspended from some C-clips from the activity arch. (He also really loves the crinkle worm that comes with the arch.) Other wooden arches that you can modify and change out are sold (see theMusinaby Selecta and theDangle & Drapeby Haba), but this is not only the best I found (and most easily modified), but is also the least expensive. A total winner!"
"Nothing ""everlasting"" about it","I have an English Pointer who is very tough on chew toys. She was able to tear a hole in the side of this ball within about 20 minutes of seeing it for the first time. While perhaps a good toy for even an average chewer, this was far less durable than ""everlasting"" may suggest."
Half-way there,"Herbie Hancock is synonomous with jazz, and the frontier of jazz.Herbie's album - Gershwin's World, I thought was a great step into the future of jazz, and this album is a lot less than it could be. I can almost hear what Herbie's trying to do, but it is a far cry from the creativity that flows from Herbie's vast mind in the past. Buy the album, but in my opinion, Herbie could have waited a little longer, and presented, to his fans, a far grander album."
Scam,Both of the cartridges I received are awful! The black ran out in about 10 copies and the color isn't even compatible with my printer! How does that work! Do not buy from this company! Best bet is to go to Office Max instead. Zero stars!!!
Excellent Summary of Political Conservatism!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The author really doesn't tell me anything new about political conservatism, but he does bring a myriad of issues together under one cover. Smith's writing style is entertaining and enlightening. For people with more of a leaning to the left, this title shouldn't be seen as a piece of trash or propaganda, but as an informative description of the positions of the political right. Although I admit to being a political conservative, I'd enjoy reading a similar volume summarizing the views of the political left!Among the many politically right-leaning books on the market today, this one is a must-read!"
Too wimpy,"Pros: It's well made and not hundreds of dollars.Cons: Several. You get the heating capacity you pay for, and this thing is simply wimpy. I use it in a standard 2-car garage which is finished and somewhat insulated, near Sacramento California in the foggy winters. It took 2 or 3 hours, at full on, to raise the temperature of the garage by more than 5 degrees. That was with a small fan blowing across it to circulate the air, main and side door closed, with 4 small screened openings for ventilation. The instructions clearly say to provide ventilation but don't say if it produces CO (carbon monoxide), so I'm going to get a detector.This model doesn't have an ignitor so get some matches or a handheld ignitor.Do not use near animals or children!! It gets very hot and will burn!Cannot recommend this as a space heater for anything larger than a tent or very small space. More BTUs are needed."
YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!,"I realize that no author, like no actor, wants to be typecast or relegated to the position of having to pursue a single character when hoping to broaden the creative portfolio. But Clancy must realize that readers, especially those who have found a hero, want to continue the story again and again and again. Jack Ryan is such a hero and we haven't grown tired yet.In Teeth of the Tiger Clancy's substitution of our hero with Jack Jr. and his cousins does not come close to repairing damages.The book does offer a well-written story, characteristic of other Clancy non-Jack Ryan novels like Rainbow Six, and may appeal to Clancy first-timers. But it's just not the same for those of us who have come to know Jack Ryan. The characters lack the personality that has become the hallmark of the Jack Ryan stories. Come to think of it, I think I will go back and reread Clear and Present Danger, Debt of Honor and Executive Orders again. You should too."
Not exactly bone-shaking,"Either the editors of these collections are getting lazy, or there are some politics involved that I don't understand. To include a ""B"" writer such as Pam Houston with greats like Rick Bass is an abomination. Other than the Bass story and a few others, this collection is dull and uninspired."
Poise Area Rug,The rug arrived with several flaws. White areas on the border that made it look like it was worn (not in a good way).It only looks purple in bright light otherwise it looks brown.I returned a month ago and have yet to receive my refund.Very unhappy with the rug and with Home Decorators Collections.
Awesome clock,This clock is absolutely beautiful. I bought it to put on our mantle and was a bit skeptical that a clock at this price point would be very nice. I read the other reviews and placed my order. The clock arrived the next day and upon unpacking I was completely amazed at how handsome it actually was. At a bit over 13 inches I was concerned it would look too small on our mantle but I was wrong. This clock is quite well made and the tone of the chimes is extremely impressive. I love the adjustable volume which allows you to hear the clock without it being annoying!! Seiko has mad a winner here! As I am writing this I hear it chiming downstairs!! Love it. Great product and great service Amazon!
BEAUTIFUL! Bad Romance,This is my first Deborah Lippmann nail polish but oh my gosh I love this sooooo much. It is super duper beautiful. The only problem that I have with this polish is that it is kind of hard to get off. But that is kind of what happens with glitter polish.
"Lacks clarity, gets lost in details","I use Plone a lot in my job and I bought both this book and The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy Mc Kay.I find this book to be confusing at best, maybe because it tries to cover too much ground. When it describes the portlets, it goes on for SIX pages describing each portlet, with a screen capture for each portlet! It talks about REST for over a page, although this architecture has really nothing to do with Plone. Etc. Etc.All in all, it seems to me that too many technical editors have worked on this book, making it overly technical and complicated. Even the font they use make the content look cluttered!It is very difficult to write something clear and simple, especially for a very piece of technical software such as Plone. In my humble opinion, this book has failed in that regard.I almost never use this book on my everyday job. Get Andy Mc Kay's book, you'll get a much better value for your money."
"man, you're blowing it.","why, why, why???with all the rumors that criterion is coming out with the TRT and BR dvds, and then this? poor form.i'm sick of the dvd comps putting out these barebones versions of movies, selling them for 20+, and then coming out with special editions months (or years) later.well, anyay, you won't find me buying this version unless it's uber cheap somewhere. i've gotta hold out for the good stuff."
Wonderful..Simply Wonderful,"Being a Stephen King fan for years, I only recently found this book and I was enthralled. Although the tale has several intermingling plots, it's a fast read. In fact I sat down and read it in less than a day. I highly reccomend this novel to Anyone!"
Great movie!,"I loved this movie! This was just a nice, feel good holiday movie. Heartwarming and nostalgic. I recommend it to all Christmas lovers!"
Brilliant performances,"This movie is very close to the novel by Cynthia Voigt. The children have acted very well and you feel everything is real. The grandmother played by Anne Bancroft is simply too good. She is equally well complimented by Dicey , the eldest of the kids who is in fact the central character. Kimberlee Peterson gives an extraordinary portrayal of this character. Hats off to the makers of this beautiful emotion packed movie.Paresh Pai,Goa India"
A very good box set for a low price,"I found this a moderate edition of the 9 Beethoven symphonies. For the cheapskate collecter, this is a great pick. The pieces are played wonderfully, with not many mistakes, and Herbert Kegel does a great job conducting this mediocre orchestra. If what you want is the overall tune, this would be good also, but if you want versions of the 9 symphonies that are perfect, buy them seperately performed by big name orchestras."
"False advertising, mediocre product","The board was initially advertised as 36""x60"", it actually measures at 36"" x 48"". The seller misrepresented the actual size of the product. Had I known the REAL dimensions I would not have purchased the product as $79.99 is on the higher end for this size board in comparison with other 36"" x 48"" boards. There are already signs of ghosting with this product as well. The only plus is the wood frame which is somewhat aesthetically pleasing but I didn't buy a white board for looks...."
"Excellent Book, Could not put it down","This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written extremely well. I had trouble putting the book down. This book describes in great detail the horrors and hardships that the Marines faced in WWII during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa from a grunt Marine's perspective. After reading this book, you will have a genuine appreciation for the sacrifices made by the young men, many in their teens, who fought one of the most horrific campaigns in U.S. military history. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our WWII veterans as well as all other veterans who have served our country and have fought to keep our freedom."
The great Balthus in his own words,"When it comes to twentieth century painters, Balthus is one of the most important and certainly one that stands out from the rest. He is enigmatic and people often misunderstand his paintings. Vanished Splendors is Balthus' memoirs that he was working on at the time of his death. In it he puts forth his philosophy on many subjects such as art, modern art, life, religion, family, love and history. He's known or met most of the important artisians of the last century. Picasso, Camus, Artaud, Monet and more. This is a quick read and gives insight into his world and how he painted (he often took years to finish one canvas). Very enjoyable and informative."
Don't listen to pple who say they're not punk.,"Everyone is judging them by punk standards. So WHAT if they're not punk. They got their own genre of music. They're unique. They're not hard rock (though some assumed they were on ""Predictable""), they're not pop, and they are not hiphop(""I just wanna live"" has too many chords and tabs to be hip hop; they put their own sound in it.) You know what? I think you shouldn't go by what pple say about them; if they say they're great or they suck. Just go buy it. It's what YOU think, not by these pple who don't like them cuz they're jealous."
the acoustics of a football stadium,"There is way too much reverb in this CD. Instead of recording in a studio, the Schubert Quartet recorded in the Nimbus Concert Hall, a venue with the acoustics of a bathroom. The sounds of the quartet jumble and muddy as their playing bounces off the walls of the hall and mix together at different times. The result, certain players sound like they're coming in too late or too early...not exactly a great effect for Mozart pieces. In Mozart, everything has to be crisp and metronomical or else it sounds messy. What we get in this recording is not the filet mignon, but the sloppy joe sandwich."
Sydney? She's OK.,"Sydney is having a big 9 mths.Her mother is expecting a child.Plus Sydney is the reluctant editor of the new school paper.THEN, she has to deal with ""Attila the Hun"" (the cafeteria cook..and real battleax),And the new school teacher, Zephyr Kennealy, a total nutcase!!What a lot for 1 kid to put up with!"
Lousy Canadian Remakes,"This is one of those ""New recordings by the Original Artists"" lousy pieces of junk - Run Away......"
Don't waste the money!,"It just is not well constructed and so although it is a great design and idea, it won't last for long no matter how little you use it. My vent clip came apart a little over two months into using it, and the clear plastic cord holder on the side broke off within a week. Spend your money instead on a different car mount cell holder that fits a variety of phones and Ipods- one that is better quality and has adjustable arms. My boyfriend likes theHeavy-Duty Universal Car Mount Holder for Cellphone, MP3 Player, iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry, Droid, GPS Garmin, TomTom, Magellanso I think I'll try this one next as it also has a car vent clip besides the window suction arm. Hope this was helpful!"
Naoko Takeuchi has done it again!,"Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon Stars #1 is one of the best mangas she did in the Sailor Moon series. Bunny & her friends have a new villian to face. This series is a fan favorite, all sailor moon fans, all ages, will LOVE!! So buy a copy of it."
Sloppy for mid sized cameras,"I will start with the build quality which is typical Tamrac, meaning well built. If you have a D200, D2x or another similarly sized camera this may be the bag for you. For me with a D80 (with or without the grip) it is really sloppy and deforms easily when the camera is out making it harder to access the front pockets or accessory bags on the sides (optional). The worse part of this back and the reason I gave it a 3 star review is the carry strap. They designed it with an angle to conform the the shoulder but instead it rides on one edge making it very uncomfortable. my Tamrac 5684 bag was much more comfortable but is too small for my larger lenses and does not support the accessory bag system. I am disapointed and shopping again for a new bag. I will most likely just buy a Lowepro Slingshot 200 to complement my 100 bag."
Flimsy packaging,Primary packaging is pretty flimsy. (lightweight cardboard) The overpack (wadded up paper) was effective though because no broken sticks!
I liked the Top 20 Teachers Better,"I bought this book in a bundle with Top 20 teachers, and parents. I believe if you have a teen this is a great book to give them. I would have loved to have read this when I was in 8-11th grades."
This Movie is a Menace,This movie is not that good compared to the Star Wars Trilogy. George Lucas should have spent more time on plannig episode One. The good parts are seeing Yoda again and a bunch of new faces. But Stars Episode One does not seem like it leads up to its trilogy.
"Great Kettle, Great Price","My mother in law turned us on to this kettle - so quick and easy to use. Cord is short, and don't over-fill because it will bubble out the spout, but other than that, it works great, quickly and holds enough for several cups of coffee / tea. Have purchased more than one of these, and they seem to last quite a while. We use ours several times a day so it gets a good work out."
Excellent program for 6 year old.,"I'm using this to teach my six year old, and couldn't be more pleased. It moves at a really slow, easy pace which is exactly what she needs. She does not feel overwhelmed and yet finds the exercise challenging. She also gets the songs stuck in her head."
Blackberry Holster,I found the holster too small for my Blackberry and I nearly lost it as it came out of the holster on its own.
"Good Charger,But it is not Full Automatic!!","If you are looking for a battery charger that you can plug in ,set it and forget it, you will need a full automatic charger not a Manually set type of charger like this one.Unfortunately, it does not describe this feature in the summary given for this product. Schumacher charger is the best charger out there."
Portable Baby Beds? HA!,"I didn't care for this product.The discription was misleading,so therefor this product wasn't usable for Me.It would be better for couples who travel&let their children sleep wth them.It's made to be usd in an adult bed."
golden valley beef jerky,product quality was disappointing. each piece of jerky had some gristle and taste was average. expected higher quality than what is typically available in supermarkets
This does deserve zero stars,"I've heard the music. It's great.But, what if a great kids toy has a fatal flaw. Some kids use it and choke to death. Not, all kids, just a few hundred. I think thats worth factoring into the rating.This CD kills PCs. Getting rid of a rootkit is hard. Sony does't even provide a way to remove it. They simply make it visible.Where is Neil Diamond on this issue? Don't the artists have some responsibility? Or, at least a voice.Pretty sounds. Evil intent. Bad product."
Cold Calling Dentistry,"This is the best book ever on the subject of telemarketing and prospecting...often (and sadly) referred to as COLD CALLING. Written with a sense of humor and a healthy balance in the reality checkbook, it steers clear of the canned script ideas perpetuated by so many of the ""sales-gurus"" and focuses on achievable goals (just making the call is seen as a success) and realistic, friendly dialogue with the person on the other end. What I enjoyed most is Ms Greene's ""angle"" that the caller not be so-damn-clever and put him/herself in the listener's place and make the process enjoyable and informative as opposed to adversarial. Read the book, visit the website, subscribe to the free e-sales-tips and take advantage of the author's offer for a hour of free coaching. What a bargain! A fun, fresh and human approach to a necessary element of building a contact base."
False Labeling. Where are the Rest of Them?,"Sadly, not All of his Greatest? So many great ones MIA here. Amazon review lists them.Is this a set-up/come on for BSGH Vol. 2?Bummer!"
"Good, but could be improved","I loved this show growing up, and it's great to see the episodes again.My problem with this is that the transfer would greatly benefit from a remastering, and the set has no extras to speak of.Still worth the price, but don't go in expecting any frills."
Perfect fit,"Put the included flange on the sensor, disconnected the battery, removed old sensor, installed new one, reconnected battery, no more check engine light."
"Oh, please","I read this book when it first came out 30 years ago. I decline to spend good money on the updated version because updated crap is still crap. It was a best-seller then because Dr. Reuben hit on a winning formula. Tittilating information (in the 60's, sex was just starting to be openly discussed), a chatty, non-clinical format that relaxed the nervous reader(most of us in those days)and a medical degree to give it respectability, Great except for one thing, Dr.Reuben knew nothing of his topics. He had no psychiatric training(California law allowed any MD to hang a psychiatrist shingle) My favorite idiocy was the notion that syphillis and gonorrhea could be eliminated by giving everyone mandatory injections of penicillin. Brushing aside the civil liberties issue, I can't think of a better way to develop a nice vicious drug-resistant strain of these diseases. The book is enjoyable only as a reminder of how gullible we were 30 years ago."
Beautiful Pin/Tie Tack,This pin/tie tack looks exactly like the picture shown. It is 10K gold with black edging for definition. The eagle is stunning. The pin/tie tack is approximately the size of a dime. Excellent for those looking for that subtle elegant touch for their lapel or tie.
Not as interesting and exciting as I thought it would be...,"I am a great fan of Tom Clancy fiction, and this book was my first read of his nonfiction series. I agree with many of the less glowing reviews previously on this book - its really more a biography of General Stiner and his administrative and command decisions throughout the years. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting a more thrilling look into the evolution of the various Special Forces specifically."
LOVE IT!,I just bought it last week and I love it. Its been great on the dry skin I get in the winter. It cost less then 3 eruo here in Germany...i guess ill have to stock up before i move home.
Disgusting Quality,How can it be so difficult to get a decent mold and at least assemble the parts without gaps and seams showing?The poor sheep is so deformed it barely stays on its feet. If it wasn't for my animal crazy grandson sitting next to me when I opened the package and latched onto these creatures I would have sent it back with an appropriate note of what you can do with these poor excuses of animals.Shame on you for selling such junk!
its great,i was surprised when i went to look at the reviews to see that there were many that didnt like this book. i think that most of them are people that like james pattersons thriller mystery stuff. funny thing is that this is the first book by him that ive read. but ive really liked it. its got a great main character. i guess many people that dont like the book are ones that only like to read information about facts. of course im a historical novel buff but i have to have a great story and meaningful characters. and this story has both. so to anyone whos looking to read a book with a lot of heart and wants a cast of characters that have feelings...this is a good one to pick up. please dont listen to the negative reviews of this one. yes the chapters are short...but is that really a reason to judge a book? give it a try i think you will like it. :)
could be better,i've been using this product for a while now. the first thing to go was the belt itself. i got a higher quality police grade belt to use. the comfort padding is great. dont spend alot on it. i use mine with the suspenders and its a great tool belt setup.
Lasts about 5 years,"I have owned this item for 5 and a half years. The first things to go were the piece of plastic that holds the item up (now it falls down all the time), the piece of plastic that holds the hose on (now the hose swings freely) and the piece of plastic that connects the hose to the detachment brush (now it has less suction). I guess for the price it was a decent 5 years but they certainly don't make items like they used to. It's called ""planned obsolescence"" - the company makes an item that they know will break in 3-5 years so you come back and buy another one. A negative side effect of capitalism. Too bad, this one is destined for the landfill because the quality is just not there."
Not convincing,"While the books premise is interesting and creative, I did not come away with the feeling that the authors had proved their point. Too many questions were left unanswered, such as why are broken fossils are found along the edges of the pyramid blocks. Entertaining, but too far outside of mainstream science to be believable."
Not one of the better historical fictional works,"I slogged through ""London"" while recuperating from a serious illness and couldn't do much but stay in bed. I was interested in the historical links, but, oh, those characters were pretty flat. Not one provoked any feeling. Why do authors believe that longer is better? Take a lesson from Hemingway. Would not recommend it."
Ew,its getting really annoying when freaky parents say things about their children in their reviews. It is soooooooooo very freaky.
Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. Full of unfounded bias. As usual, Mr. O'Reilly has an agenda and it is so far from the reality of life in America today. Mr O'Reilly should stick to what he does best; hype his TV ratings by yelling uncontrollably at his guest when someone disagrees with him or trys to offer another point of view."
If you like terrific acting and believable characters/see it,"This is a wonderful movie to see if you enjoy great acting and character development. Not a particularly ""happy"" story line, but neither is it especially depressing, since you know up front that Meryl Streep's character will die. A superb acting (and reacting) performance by Meryl's daughter."
Buyer beware,"I have a different MP3 from this company, but I need to warn anybody considering a purchase from Digitalway. My MP3 failed within 6 weeks - customer service is impossible to get a hold of, even more difficult to understand than the User Manual, and unwilling to send the return/repair forms. The 120 day warranty is worthless."
Only worked for 2 months,"This was a good little player, and I would have given a much better review if it hadn't died on us, twice. The first one lasted 2 weeks and wouldn't charge or power on anymore so we sent it back. This one did the same thing 2 months later, and they won't take it back because it has been too long. watch out!"
"Great Concept,but poor execution.","Malevolence is a horror movie that tells the tale of a deranged lunatic that tortures and kills women. The story touches on Martin Bristol a six year old boy that was kidnapped over ten years ago and became the student of this psychotic killer. The story has another plot going as well about four people that have committed a bank robbery and are on the run. One of the robbers in an attempt to get away car jacks a women and her young daughter and takes them to an abandoned house where he waits for the other bank robbers to arrive. The story gets really creepy and confusing and you just want it to end. I just discovered Anchor Bay Films and I'm quickly becoming a fan, but this one just didn't do it for me. The prequel to this movie ""Bereavement"" is a much better movie, but it still lacks the gripping conclusions that I love in a good horror film, but the storylines are much more cohesive than Malevolence."
Great Purchase,"My son and I loved this on Netflix and were so disappointed when they took it off. What a great surprise to find that Amazon offered the series at a low price, with a significant number of episodes. When my son opened the package on Christmas, I knew it was a win!!!"
What!!?,"This cd starts with some great guitar work and then it goes down hill from there. This cd with the exception of the first song, is a snoozer."
very danceable,"I guess if you read to much into this cd then I guess it could be questionable, but my daughter loved dancing to it before she was even 2! Now she's almost 3 and I'm going to get the single. She dosen't understand all the words and it's over her head anyway. I think it's a cute song."
"Good product, but don't expect miracles","My now 10 month old has had repeat ear infections for the last 4 months. I purchased this in hopes that I would be able to see inside of his ears and know for a fact whether or not I needed to take him back to the doctor.I gave this 3 stars because we haven't had any problems with it; we just can't see anything inside of my son's ear besides ear wax. Granted, I am not in the medical profession and am by far no expert, but with all the good reviews I figured it would help us out, but it hasn't. So far it has been a waste of money for us. Maybe we will get more use out of it when he gets a little older and less squrimy (or can be bribed to sit still, lol)."
Very good quality plugs,"Installed these plugs into a 2009 1200 sportster, they are great plugs. Highly recommend this product. The pricing is fair and if you buy at the auto parts store you are going to pay more.."
Just finished reading this book...,"I don't want to tell the story, and ruin the purpose of this book. This was an AWESOME book. If you saw the movie, you'll like the book better. The book expresses more feeling and detail. The book made me cry, especially Antwone's first real christmas gift. It's a tear-jerker. The sad part is, all of it is true."
i dont own it but i HATE it,this album is pure crap it so stupid it is just some dipstickuseing a voice perfecter pop music is the stupidest thing in the hole world buy Metallica's album ... and justice for all. that is WAY better than this crap
Wish They Were Here,"Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"" is superb. Wish they were here to be welcomed to the machine so they could shine on like crazy diamonds. I love this!!! ***** TEN STARS *****"
Not the same as pictures,"In my case the ring pictured is a bit different than the ring I received: the silver on the ring I received is thinner - inside of the ring is full in pic but most of it hollow in person, gem has much less details and top is quite flat not like the pic, stone color is darker... If you are lucky you will receive a nice ring, otherwise you will receive something slightly different than what you thought you bought. Used a Amazon gift certificate and will not send back but no more jewelry through Amazon."
Not for Vista!,"This scanner will NOT work with Vista. HP has no Vista driver for it, and apparently no intention of ever supplying one. A generic scanner program doesn't seem to solve the problem either. don't try this with Vista."
Never Arrived,So we cancelled the order. It was cancelled without any problem. That is a positive note...
"Cute, but...","The illustrations are interesting and nice. But this edition is certainly not a ""user"". Page numbers are all ""inside"" - along the binding side and at the bottom of the pages. To accommodate the illustrations you can go six pages without a page number. When you try to use this book as a reference, the illustrations just get in the way, breaking up your train of thought.Not that I'm pushing book sales, but if you get this illustrated edition (or plan of giving it as a gift), do yourself a favor and also get the paperback version. That way you have something you can actually use, as well as having a volume for muse."
The Best of Django Reinhardt,"This man is brilliant. However, after listening, it is not my style of jazz...which does not reflect on this man's genius."
Sounds good to me,"Looking over the reviews, it seems as though many astute Morrissey fans find this effort mediocre at best. I don't know. I like it. ""You Have Killed Me"" features remarkably surprising lyrics, powerful vocals and an unforgettable melody. ""At Last I Am Born"" hit me the same way. My favorite tune by far is ""Life Is a Pigsty"". Besides the quintessential Morrissey title, the song is oozing with passion, and somehow manages to be grim and uplifting at the same time, as many of Morrissey's better efforts do. True, some of the other tunes are rather routine by Morrissey standards, but these three alone make Ringleader worth the $$."
"Unique, unique and hey.....did I say unique?","I've just returned from three months in the Sertao region of Bahia Brasil. Que legal! I stumbled upon Afrocyberdelia through a friend and immediately went to the loja de discos to see what else this master of fusion had to offer.What did I find? Da lama ao caos! This masterpiece of ear candy that blends just about every type of rhythm-full music you can imagine.If you can score the double disc set (I imagine it will be available here soon), grab it also. It has some great B-sides, live stuff and great mixes by some of the best Drum and Bass/Jungle DJs as well as the master himself, David Byrne. Get it? Got it? Good!"
Avoid this,"I won't spend a lot of time on this as I've already wasted 95 minutes watching it. In short, this was one of the stupidest movies I've seen. The jokes aren't funny, just crude, and the plot is banal. Don't waste your time or money."
New Line is just GREEDY,"Studios wonder why Blu Rays have not taken off. The pricing is just ridiculous, with retail prices in the $30-$40 range.In this economy, consumers won't buy the initial versions, if they don't have the extended or unrated versions!Serious film fans want to support the studios, but feel TAKEN (Big company Gotcha!), when so many versions of a film are released.I no longer buy the initial version, when originally released as I know, that a later, more updated version is coming at a lower price!PS I own several hundred SD DVDs, with another 200 Blu & HD DVDs."
horror,this film is one you don't want to eat while watching. it's very good in the gore department. i really would recommend it to any one
Wide Asleep in America,A waste of time and money for only four song and they no different then you could find on a studio album.
Will the Real Harlan Coben Please Stand Up?,"Is this the same Harlan Coben I've come to know and love? The Harlan Coben who gave us Myron Bolitar?Ugh.I'm about halfway through ""Just One Look"" and ready to cast it aside. This reads like the first-draft, fourth-rate, churn-'em-out dreck that litters bestseller lists (think Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel). Where's the trademark Coben snappy dialog? the informed insider's slant on topics like professional sports? the twisting yet plausible plots? the smart cynicism tinged with heart and style? Where's Big Cindy when we really need her?Harlan, we hardly knew ye."
SO Disappointing!,"I really am very disappointed with Dave's style of music on this CD. Its almost disgusting! Sure some people may like the style, but its not Dave. No studio release will ever beat Under the Table and Dreaming. I sure hope Dave's next studio release will not be like this one, this one was completely disgusting. Everyday was the only song i could put up with, and even that one i was just sitting there like ""Is this even Dave Matthews?"" It is not at all Dave's style. So if you have never heard this CD and like Dave's original style, DO NOT GET THIS CD! You will be very disappointed. If you think any of those songs would be good live, I've been to 15 DMB Concerts this year and i heard about every song on that CD live, IT IS NOT ANY BETTER! The Space Between just is sickening. I'm not saying that any of the songs are bad, none of these songs are Dave."
You MUST read ONE book in this series,"I really enjoyed reading the first book in this series, but subsequent books were repetitive. The research that obviously went into it makes for genuine characters, and the insight into humanity as seen through the eyes of an alien species is humorous, at times. But don't bother to read the whole series. I'm starting the 4th book now, and I haven't really gotten anything new out of the 2nd or 3rd book.But don't get me wrong. I really liked the first book."
Great review book,"I don't know if this is a good book for beginner's, but I learned to tat from my grandmother a millinium ago, and this is a great refresher to allow me to pick it up."
Equivalent to Donkey Dung,"Being a multiple myself and knowing a--forgive the pun--host of others, I must say that this is one of those books that gives a bad name to our community. This woman was not only socially and legally irresponsible, but down right nutty. Personally, I think whoever diagnosed her as multiple did her a grave diservice. The woman seemed more likely schitzophrenic to me. And UGH! It was terribly written!"
was suggested by a friend but ?,It was suggested by a friend but have read much better books of poverty survival. Not in the catagory of good reading I think
Not so fast,I really like movies of this type but Solomon Kane was too slow paced throughout and the acting wasn't believable.
The Most Disturbing Movie. Period.,"I rented this movie a couple months ago, and I didn't know what to expect. It started out really cheesy, but then it got really disturbing. People in the movie would get killed, and then the characters in the movie would laugh. I have seen a lot of gore, and this movie had plenty, but that's not what was disturbing. I truly think the creator of this movie has pyschological issues. Overall, it's a good movie to see once, just so you can see where I'm coming from."
Keys don't work,"Right off the bat, seven of the keys on the right side did not function at all. I sent it back to Amazon. I received no support from Fellowes. They're now officially off my approved vendor list."
How NOT To Make A Film!,"This is the perfect film to show future filmmakers exactly what NOT to do in every category from acting to directing! It is such an abysmal film that my heart sunk with every spoken word. I was nauseous with pity for every character and person involved with this schlock-fest! My God, what were they thinking??? It is so bad that any wanna-be filmmaker will either get an A+ after watching this or change careers immediately! I'd give away the ending, but I don't remember if there was one!Over-wrought gay ""hunny-bunny"" scenes, violently religious and hateful parents, sterotyped neighbor and plenty of time to get snacks in-between scene(s). It's nearly a one room film shot."
Doggie's Friend,"My doggie loves this ice cream doggie toy. It is the only one he pays any attention to. When you order this toy, you are sent three or four others with it. I tried twice to reorder just the yellow ice cream face toy, but Hartz insisted I get all the others in a pkg deal. Disappointment."
The softer side of P.E.B.,"This is my favorite P.E.B. album. I have always been more of a fan of his melodic compositions and this one is filled with them. Nearly every track on this album is beautiful and relaxing. This album doesn't have as much bass as his other albums, but I don't like Techmaster P.E.B. for the bass, I like him for the music.If anybody knows what is going on with P.E.B. these days, please let me know!!"
Chased By the Lght: A 90-Day Journey,"I've great respect for this photographer and love his photographs and written testimony on his work and his relationship with his subjects. This book has wonderful photos. That said, many of the photos are pretty small, and my preference is for the image to fill the page, or a large part of it. Still this work is a powerful story about this piece of earth and the creatures (including this author) on it."
this sucked!,"there is nothing about this dvd that was any good. it seemed to be a bad reproduction of a bad reproduction of a really good movie. the audio was off and awful, the resolution... welll it just sucked. save your money. get the bruce lee collection instead. this was a waste of money and time."
this sucks,"this album is just what i would expect from a band with the word ""theory"" in their name. i have seen them play live and it is actually worse than the album - if that's possible. for some reason people think this band is good, but that's probably because they are from akron where there are no descent bands. anyway, don't buy this album unless you feel like laughing."
Great movie...,I thought the movie was really good. Never heard of it before and purchased it because of the price for a Affleck production seemed like a worthwhile movie. I was right. I really like it.
2...maybe 3 good songs out of 14...,"i bought this cd because i loved the single Leave (get out) and i had money on me and i can never control myself when it comes to spending.but i'll admit, JoJo has a beautiful voice, very soulful, she sounds like a black female singing. yet....only 13... she's got potential, but i think this CD has been veeery manufactored.if you're anything like me, who likes the mainstream music on the radio right now..i like ashlee simpson, avril, modest mouse, katy rose , rooney, dashboard confessionals, usher, alicia keys...im tellin ya i like ALL types of music, but im not into poppy same soundin' music like JoJo has on her CD....just borrow it frm a friend or DL these three songs:Breezy ((and im not sure if i really like this song or not, cause its back and forth for me....))Leave (get out)Weak.....so save your money and dont be like me."
Truth & Beauty,"Yes, C. Dale Young has written a gorgeous first collection, but beauty--of landscape, of the love between men, of art--is never for its own sake, and never at the disservice of truth. For underneath all of the fine details are concerns of exile and empire in his Caribbean poems (one in particular, ""On Privilege,"" belongs in all of the anthologies); and the impermanence of art and love. This is a bold, polished, and often tender (see ""Broughtonia"") first book, filled with rich, complicated poems that repay rereading. Do not miss this book."
Awsome:),"It was good! Old but good. Maybe recently restored, my HDTV played it well! I haven't seen this movie in a while but enjoyed it none the less."
Riviting,Couldn't put it down. It grasped my attention from the beginning and kept it to the end. Would love to read more from this author
The title is wrong (Cerebrovascular not Cardiovascular),The title in the Amazon.com catalog is wrong.It's Cerebrovascular not Cardiovascular.
Plastic!,"Not sure what's cheaper, myself wanting to pay $10 for a 25ft measuring tape - or the chromed plastic imitation that this thing is made of.My 5 yr old used it for a few minutes and the 'chrome' is all scratched. I doubt this will survive falling on the floor.It should say plastic on the product description."
Scratches hardwood floors,"The front part of the base ahead of the brushes has hard plastic ridges that scratch my hardwood floors. I have tried to wrap, glue, screw,.....something soft over them but have not yet succeeded. If it were not for this it would be a great little machine."
Coleman insulated sport bottle,"good item, keeps liquid cold, adjustable strap. I added a pad from a back pack to make it more comfortable on my shoulder. Only drawback is the 64oz capacity makes it heavy on long hikes, like carrying a 2 liter bottle around. I recommend filling it 1/2 to 3/4's full only."
"Christmas music as it should be, warm and cozy.","'N Sync, what can I say. This album packed the whole spirit of Christmas in a neat little round disc with a pretty little bow that's 'N Sync. The guys sing about being with family and loved ones during this magical time of the year on the 14-track album which includes the typical oh-so-sweet songs such as ""the Only Gift"" and ""I Never Knew the Meaning of Christmas"", happy holiday tunes like ""Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays"" and ""Kiss Me at Midnight"", and also a snappy rendition of the traditional Christmas favorite ""Oh Holy Night"" , done a cappella. The album possesses the general moods of Christmas, the perfect gift to round off any prepubescence female's year. And as always, the guys are stayin' 'n sync:)"
we are all stars...,"John Cale was always the cool member of the Velvet Underground. I used to see him ten years ago walking around the East Village. I didn't know it was him, but one day I saw him for the tenth time and said to myself: ""That is John Cale."" Lately he has been doing film scores and being interviewed for punk documentaries. He was in the center of the punk movement because he produced a lot of cool albums. His solo work has always been hit or miss. It has always been interesting. Listening to his voice in songs like the song ""Zen"" he reminds me of Tindersticks. Cale has always been art obsessed. Here he does a song called ""Magritte."" This album is overall pretty damn good. Nobody really expects him to do anything new or good, but John Cale surprises us. He is still an artist with a vision."
Love it,"This is the best coffee maker ever, the coffee ois wonderful too and I have one of these at home, work and my camper"
Excellent!,This was a Christmas gift for a beer lover and they were super stoked to try it out. They went through the process of making it and were satisfied with the product overall.
Bad smell,"I bought this fragrance because i saw the good reviews, but it smell bad and it is away too strong for a woman. it smell like cheap fragrances. fortunately i bought just the smallest bottle they have. but I'm giving it to someone else. i just can't stand to this weird smell."
I dont feel it,"Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
Exciting Action Movie,"Great military movie, lots of action and current topic. Top stars and fast paced plot keep you riveted to the screen!"
NOT AS SHOWN,"Four stars because it's a great bar, one star off because it's not the bar that's shown in the ad. The bar advertised does not have balls on the ends, but the one you get does. I hate these balls because they break and then you're left with a bar with a threaded hole in the end. They should advertise it correctly."
Wrong item shipped,"I ordered the Keypad from Toshiba Direct, they sent me the wrong item, they shipped me the full sized keyboard, and refused to exchange it unless I paid for postage. Customer service rep said they do not and have never made a mistake. Therefore I will rate the keyboard for the keypad I ordered, it is way to big to fit in my laptop case."
Great way to spruce up your stove!,"These match my dishes. I have an electic stove and they help make it look very nice. Also, I have limited counter space, so they make a nice surface on my stove to work in the kitchen. You have to make sure you take them off the stove before heating the oven! They can discolor and burn!"
Overly analytical,This book wasn't good at all. It took me several times of picking it up and putting it back down for a few weeks to finally get through most of it. The author goes through a situation too many times. She is overly analytical of everything happening instead of just telling a story.
Only For Jed and Granny,"I like Dolly alot, but his music is REALLY bad.Please make more 'mainstream"" music again!! This one is on it's way to used the store."
A-OK,"The one I got leaked at the bottom of the handle, so I returned it for a new one. I've had the replacement for a few months now and it works just fine. There's nothing special to say about this kettle, it's relatively cheap and it works."
Product not up to Microsoft standards,I have been using Microsoft keyboards since the first ergonomic keyboards were introduced. The keyboard I just retired was over 8 years old and it was worn out. This new keyboard has all the features I want but it just never worked properly. The spacebar key is more difficult to press than the other keys. It didn't seem like a big deal at first but it got worse over time and really started to wear on me. The other big problem was that the keyboard and mouse would stop responding for periods up to 30 seconds. This would happen several times a day. I moved the USB receiver from the back of my computer to the front and the problem improved but never fully resolved. I have been forced to switch to a Logitech keyboard (which I don't like as well) but at least it works.
good as gold,The same familiar cast provides a pleasant and exciting movie. Greatly entertaining for the whole family.
Pure Brilliance,"I will admit that my first listen to this album was a complete shock, and I was not sure what to think. But isn't this what real rock music is all about? Must everything be streamlined and accessible from the first listen?It is true that only 3 songs are based on the electric guitar that Jack White is known for, but many of the piano songs are surprisingly upbeat and ""rock"" more than anything that most bands put out nowadays. Yes, there is also bluegrass, folk and old-time piano lounge songs, but these are great songs once the intial shock has faded.I am guessing that most of the negative reviews are from those who have not given the time to absorb the album. I have heard this album compared to Exile on Main Street by some critic. Not because they sound similar (they don't) but because of the wide range of genres. I know it took me several listens to appreciate the brilliance of Exile. Get Behind Me Satan is no different. Possibly the White Stripes best album."
An interesting collection of essays - 4 *,"This book consists of 12 essays, written by such important personages as Bertrand Russel, Hermann Bondi, Edward Condon, Julian Huxley and Erich Fromm. These essays were written for a general audience, but one that was not afraid of some math, physics and a few chemical symbols. For the most part they detail some of the history of their subject and a little about it. The big negative is the age of the book. Being originally written in 1955 (the hardcover version), much of the content is seriously out of date. This is especially true of the Bondi's Astronomy and Cosmology chapter. Thus, I could only rate the book 4 stars."
"Fun, but not worth the price","The Create your Own Goddess kit comes with a book, some clay, and a modeling tool. The book is the only thing worth buying in this kit, however, making the kit overpriced. The clay was like a rock, and even after soaking it in water for what seemed like ages, I found it difficult to use and mold. I threw it out and used Sculpey clay instead.The book is excellent, however. It talks about creating Goddess altars, gives meditations for each of the Goddesses presented, and lays out detailed instructions for creating the figures within. There are many Goddesses presented from many different cultures. Some of the statues are very simple to create, others require more skill, meaning it will take some time to grow out of the activities in this book.Buy the book, use Sculpey clay instead, and you've got an interesting activity for many meditative afternoons."
"""Hypnotic""","I really didn't like this book when I first started reading it, but my thoughts were, I bought it, now I got to read it! When I finished the book, I kept thinking about how keeping secrets effects people. In this book, the life of Amanda was totally different of what it could have been. She has mental problems, mood swings, clings to Ruth way too much. Although i could relate to her as a single mom, I don't think she made many wise decisions in her life. It made my think about my own life and how I do not want to live in bondage from my past mistakes. I found this book hynotizing. I keep thinking about even weeks after I've finshed it. One thing I didn't about it is the way it flashed back and forth from past to present, I could barely keep up. I did think the story was great and thoroughly enjoyed it."
Amazing!,"Save the bucks and don't bother for the IS or IS II. This lens is so fast that you won't need a tripod or monopod 90% of the time. The color, contrast, sharpness are just second to none. I've had many other 2.8 quality lenses including Canon and Nikon and nothing even comes close to it. Take my word. If you spend $1,300 today (by the way it is a steal) and sell it 3 years later you'll get a $1,000 back. That is the beauty about owning quality equipment and keeping them in good shape."
Not recommended,"Many of these stories are far too sinister for small children. Be prepared for tales of dismemberment, divine wrath, ghosts, train wrecks, madness and violent death... and that's just the first two entries in the ""Winter"" section. Skipping around I also found a lovely poem about a Badger being baited, tortured and killed.Maybe my infant child isn't ""extremely intelligent"" after all. He seems to prefer ""Goodnight Moon"" to Mr. Bloom's anthology. I know I do."
This is just silly,"This is just silly.While of course I do understand that like attracts like, that is just the beginning. Creation is more complex than that. There are 3 components of creation in this world that we live in. Thought word and action. Thought is the beginning which should lead to word which is more concrete and more powerful than thought, which leads to action which is then more concrete and powerful in this world than either thought or word.If you have (clarity, intensity, duration) of (thought, word, action) in this world you create. That is the formula. That is how you become a powerful creator in this physical world of time and space.Unfortunately this program takes just one piece of that formula and expands it as if it was the entire universe. Hogwash. This program claims that clarity of thought is the whole answer. Well it just does not work that way.Good start, woefully inadequate.BTW - great marketing!"
Very loud.,"It works quite well, as far as electric razors go. Dry, it does a decent job of getting rid of visible hair, but there is usually a little stubble left that you can feel if your run your hands up and down your legs. In the shower it works nearly as well as regular razor. There might be certain areas this one can't get to that you will have to touch up on with a normal razor.The only real complaint I have is how loud it is. Everyone in your house WILL know when you are shaving your legs."
Funny!,"Season 1 is not the best season of The Simpsons, America's best and most watched television show, but it is worth buying. Season 1 of The Simpsons is when the show was still trying to find its feet, but the episodes are still funny and everything that you would expect from The Simpsons and its slew of colorful characters. The best part of the DVD are the extras. there are commercials, sketches, concepts, interviews, enough to make any hardcore Simpsons fan go bonkers with excitement! If you are a fan of the hilarious yellow people on The Simpsons, you should buy Season 1. You just wouldn't feel right without it. Refresh your memory of the good ol' days when we were still all trying to figure out why Homer is so stupid and why Marge's hair is blue. If you still don't know, or you have never even heard of the Simpsons, you should buy the DVD to get all of the answers. If you love the phrase Doh! or Don't Have a Cow Man! buy the DVD. It' that simple."
Hemp Wallet,"Well made wallet and should last a few years. I wish it had more pockets for storge, I have to use the Billfold pocket for credit card storage. This practice has already resulted in dumping serveral cards on the floor, unfortunately there is only 2 pockets for cards. But I must say it is very comfortable to carry in your pocket."
Terrible product and poor customer service!!,I was given this camcorder as a Christmas present when I gave birth to twin girls. I recorded on it and found it would not finalize and repeatedly received a disk error message. I tried again and got the same message. Now I have two unviewable disks with precious family memories on them. When I called customer support I got a woman who barely spoke English who went through several steps with me and then told me to only purchase Memorex RW disks. There should be a warning with the camera. Nowhere in the owners manual is a specific brand name disk mentioned. I did use a Sony disk once and it did finalize but am at a loss as to what to do with others. I am very unhappy with this product.
Essential Truths,Very easy to read and understand. Well written book. Presents doctrine in a format that is theologically sound and understandable for the lay theologian.
Overkill for amateur videographer.,"While this book contains lots of technical information made simple, it's an overkill if you are not oriented in transfering your DV to film. Initially it's so good you can't put it down but 2/3 of the way, unless you want to transfer to film it's an overkill."
Okay,"This game is good but I think they could do without the ant that pops up to tell you you are going bankrupt every 5 seconds. They should let you be in the park and not always an overhead view, go in the shops, and actually stand in line for rides."
Only watched it for Ewan,"When I rented Nora from the video store, I was pleasantly suprised to find the first film I'd ever seen about James Joyce. If you like literature- such books as The Unbearable Lightness of Being, you would adore James Joyce's work. Nora, like the movie version of T.U.L.O.B lost some literary beauty (as all books-turned-movies do), but not so much that I lost total interest. I give it an A minus!"
Very good budget speaker mounts.,"They are exactly as promised and were easy enough to mount and use. Have a pair ceiling mounted for my rear surround speakers and they are doing fine. They included hardware was all I needed, plus my cordless drill. The swivel mounts tighten up good and I have not seen any slippage for the speakers (4 lbs each). The speakers use keyhole mounting and the setup for these does not tighten up as much as I would like but it does does OK. I wanted white mounts to be unobtrusive, which they are. The construction is not flimsy at all. Have ordered ordered three more sets for another setup I am helping with."
Of historical interest...,An amusing little read - - but buy O'Neil's book on how to make money in the stock market if you really want to get into the detail.
Patti showing passion again,This album is not Easter or Horses or even Radio Ethiopia but it is damn good. Not as good as the 70's output but good nonetheless. The songs are not as memorable as her classic material but still exhibit her passion and insight. She would release her album of cover or other artists songs with Twelve a few years after this which is perhaps her best album and does rate with her 70's material. This album showcases Patti Smith returning to form.It is remarkable to see an artist regain their spirit and intensity that spiraled their careers return with the same passion. This album is a must for any Patti Smith enthusiast.
Poor Quality,"I bought this tool and expected a quality tool for a great price, what i received was a tool barely worth the money i payed for it.Pro - It seems accurateCons - Mine never turns off, I have to remove battery.- When you are trying to get readings sometimes the readout goes crazy and just starts puking out different numbers when trying to measure.Overall i'm disappointed in this product. The price is the only thing that saves it from being a 1 star review. If your needs require accurate measurements, and you need something that will be consistent I would highly suggest a different caliper."
Discrepancies and falsehoods,"Page after page contains discrepancies and falsehoods. Eager doesn't seem to know the difference between C rations and K rations, for example. But he does say he arrived in Vietnam on Feb. 9, 1968, and he names a number of men killed in his unit. Unfortunately for him, members of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade Association have a complete list of 196th LIB members who were killed in Vietnam. Eager's KIA names do not match those on the list.I read 96 pages before Eager's fascination with torture, murder and mutilation sickened me and made me put the book down. If you want a provocative book about Vietnam, read ""Stolen Valor"" by B.G. Burkett, Glenna Whitley. Heavily documented, the book tells how and why hundreds of frauds have posed as Vietnam veterans to gain attention, money, special treatment in prison, and VA disability payments."
Terrible Sub-Titles - A Disappointing Film At Best,"I'm not sure about the film some of these other reviewers saw, but I could not stand this movie.For one thing - one very critical thing - it's got some of the most UNREADABLE subtitles ever!Which, I'm sure, added to my complete lack of enjoyment.I'm an Independent Film fan and I was looking forward to seeing this movie but it's disconnected and at times, just unwatchable.The story meanders and the lighting isn't so great either.I was very disappointed.Be careful if you're planning on purchasing this DVD.Try to rent it first - check the foreign section of your favorite video store.Best Regards, turtlex"
This doesn't work well for me,"I've had this for several months, and I use it about twice a week on my feet while I'm showering. It hasn't softened up at all and doesn't foam for me, and I tend to not use it because it's unpleasant. I think I'm going to look for a different pumice stone and give up on this one."
Some interesting characters lost in an implausible framework,"While the relationships of the first generation of Ya-Yas made for some good reading, the framing story of the oldest daughter of the most outrageous Ya-Ya was trite, boring, and, as a result, a little intrusive. Wells was a little lazy in her characterizations (for all their brass and sass, the Ya-Yas do not have distinctive voices), and she completely failed to engage me in the story of the adult daughter. The ""Gone With the Wind"" episode was memorable, as were a handful of others, but the overall effect was severely handicapped by Wells's sloppiness as a writer. These poor women never seemed real to me, and, in the end, the point of the story (the daughter's redemption) looked a little too self-serving for comfort."
Great beard and hair trimmer,PowerfuL and really easy to use.. It has multiple settings that stay in place even with applied pressure. Works great for my haircut and trimming my beard. There is not a docking station just a simple plug. Not a big deal but if you keep it out on your counter it could look sloppy.
Great answerer horrible handset,"Love the answering machine, tho it's got so many functions it's not easy to use them all.Hate the phone - not rugged enough and audio is lousy. Using a headset helps but it doesn't hang in the cradle with the headset plugged in. Slow to answer when you hit the button, and sometimes I have to pull the battery to reset the handset to get it working again.I expected better from AT&T;."
I do not recommend,"We recently bought 2 of these seats for our daughters age 4 and 3. Both girls are small for their age (10th percentile on growth charts). The harness buckle that comes between their legs is too big. When they wear shorts or dresses, the buckle and its strap cuts into their legs. Again, these are tiny little legs. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. We paid $110 each and quickly recycled the boxes. We have little hope of a refund or exchange."
pretty good box set,there are only a few flaws with this boxset 1st not all the films are widescreen 2nd its a cheap boxset by that i mean the dvd boxes are the slim boxes like the friday the 13th collection i might take a pic of it and post it so you know what i mean. i hope this help you!
Fatal flaw: no storage underneath the crib!,"The crib is solid enough and fairly easy to install, however, the front rail is fixed so low that it is impossible to slide anything underneath to store it. For example, we have another crib that we store boxes of diapers and wipes underneath. Look at the clearance on the lower front frame, you can't slide anything more than like 5 inches underneath..."
Painstakingly detailed!!!,"I worked through this text in a doctoral seminar on the Arian Crisis. It is without doubt a must read to grasp the intricacies involved in the early patristic struggle of identifying the triune God. Hanson was too harsh on Athanasius, in my opinion. However, the book is an essential guide and will be consulted again and again. Solid scholarship if sometimes a little lop-sided!"
Depressing...,Have you ever noticed how nobody in anime stories ever wins? Especially not the good guys. Massively depressing with a sound trak that is so ominous that it alone is enough to make you double your Prozac.
moneymaker,patterson seems to have churned this one out just for the money. The plot has been done to death. He seems more interested in name dropping than plot development. You can tell this one was written as a movie--I'll think twice before I buy another one of his books.
messy,It is very easy for the dish to get messy. The lid sits down in the bottom and so if there is any butter it gets on the lid. Better butter dishes don't sit down on the bottom part. It doesn't even look that nice since the bottom and top are slightly different colors. Not recommeded.
"Totally unique sound, I love the CD","I really love this CD, As a trumpet player myself, I just love the way he plays, he took a sound that most music teachers would tell you not to make on a trumpet, and made it musical. If you are into interesting music, this ones for you."
Maybe fit to be tied is a better title ....,"I really really have to be more carefull when I buy some of these 'wham bang thank you mam' kind of books .... I can't even believe that this is one of a series of Penny books .... WOWI mean this is a book that really gets into from the get go; 'My a... ring gave, the plug popped inside and it had been done.' is the first sentence in the book. This scene starts the description of Penny being starkers with only the mask of a fox and of course a tail (check first sentence) being set free in the woods while a group of male and female hunters would try to hunt down the 'fox' for her goodies ....I guess if you are a closet submissive then parts of this bok would be interesting ....."
"Good, dependable camera","I need a camera that has excellent macro functions. So I'm going to get another brand. But I've enjoyed this camera. It's easy to use. It doesn't take much space. And it is very easy to upload the photos and work with the camera.If you want a very good camera at a reasonable price, this is a good one. Good for print or the Web."
flawless,I received the speakers very quickly. I love them. They sound great! The best speakers I have ever owned. I can hardly believe the price was so low. Research and listen to these speakers before you spend a mint on any others!
Not as good as the first two,"This movie is just not as funny as the first two. In addition, somehow number 2 is back, even though he died in the first movie. Austin Powers's father has a hatred for Dutch people that the movie doesn't explain. There is an attempt to get as many actors in this movie as possible. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater because I would not have bought it."
Quite Boring,"When I saw this Batman & Superman combination, from John Byrne no less, I was excited to pick it up. Boy was I disappointed. The concept is intruiging and the whole premise attempts to humanize superheroes but I found the whole story boring and quite uninteresting. It was almost half over before I began to more than bored but then the whole thing was unbelieveable (I know it's only a comic) and the end was really weak. The whole thing would have been better if it had been told in an epic format and been a little darker. I noticed a sequel is coming out but based on this story I recommend avoiding it altogether!"
"Deceptive lead,","Noting the weights of ""flat-panel"" vs standard monitors with ""flat-screens"", you will notice the ave weight of a flat panel is 12 to 16 pounds...standard monitors with flat screens ave weight is 40 to 65 pounds.This monitor's weight is a dead give-away to being a STANDARD MONITOR with a flat screen weighing in at 50 pounds.Buyer beware! and be AWARE!"
workbook with no answers,full of questions and no answers...how do you test yourself on multiple choice questions with no answer key...? Pretty pointless. Going to return it asap.
Helped me get over a cold faster!!,"The day I receive this I happened to have been sick for the 4th time in 3 months with a cold. The reason why I ordered it in the first place was because of this and I thought my immune system needed a boost. I haven't really been getting the necessary vitamins and minerals I thought I needed so I thought I give this a try. I also heard that it was good for hair and nail growth which I never really had a problem with anyway so I didn't worry to much about that.I started taking the Mineral Rich right away and in about 3 days my cold was gone with just some minor coughing here and there, but I haven't been sick since which is great since I'm around so many people all the time. The flavor was good and it didn't bother my stomach at all and I didn't have any side effects like others have listed. I do take it after eating a full meal and I mix it in a glass of water."
Intriguing,Great story with plenty of suspense. Really good chronicle of a new believer's walk with Christ. Excellent portrayal of how the occult can affect someone's life.
Organic bliss Trust this Swaddler!,"Organic bliss Trust this Swaddler!Simply the best blanket I have, its softness is organically perfect.Its warm and trust the goodness of organic"
"""24""","Overall i am satisfied with the product. However. Disk 4 of Season one was damaged, and I could not view any of the episodes."
Received wrong item,"Instead of receiving the flash unit ordered, I was sent a small camera bag with a small tripod for a small digital camera. I believe I was cheated and therefore will be quite careful of ordering from an Amazon supplier again."
Pointless and disappointing,"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them."
"""could i have this kiss forever"" not the proper version","I sampled this CD prior to purchase and was misled of course, I did not know it at the time or I would not have wasted my money). The version of ""Could I have this kiss forever"" on the CD is slow, morbid and horrifying to listen to--THE ONE ON THE SAMPLE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT--AND MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE. The 2 versions therefore do not match, which is very misleading to customers. Amazon offers the option of sampling songs prior to purchase so as to inform customers of what they can expect to hear upon purchase. In this case, however, that did not happen, which is very deceiving. When selling music, the seller should make certain that the song samples match the actual songs on the cd, so annoying situations like this do not occur. Dissatisfied customers lead to zero profits."
"Fun, Entertaining, not for everyone!","I loved the book. I could relate to some areas of his Harley learning experience, like going from a Sporty to a Big Twin, although I was a bit more into the performance rather than add on cosmetics, right from the start. Also I can relate looking through Easyriders looking at and reading about what other have done to their bikes. It becomes consuming!!"
Headphones,"The noise canceling works pretty well. The sound quality is ok. Practically NO bass tones. I like the retractable cord. But, it is about one foot too short. This is really a noise canceling device, with the plug in audio sort of thrown in."
Chris is Back!,"""Speak of the Devil"" was the departure for Chris. This new album is definitely in line with ""Forever Blue,"" ""San Francisco Days,"" and ""Heart-Shaped World""--and that's a good thing! There is lots to enjoy here--""Let Me Down Easy"" is quite charming; ""Notice the Ring"" and ""Always Got Tonight"" are witty and edgy. Mostly, there are songs about heartbreak--and would you want anything else from a Chris Isaak record? If you are a Chris Isaak fan, you will like this album; if you are new to his music, this is a good introduction."
Less than It Is,"It was ok, but less than outstanding. Like most of Davids books it is quite long---nearly 300 pages---and takes a long time to read. I would have like to have seen real photos (instead of black and white paintings)of Washington and his crew and of George the King, but the writer included none.. After 300 pages and weeks of reading, we don't even get to learn who won the war.I saw David on PBS and find his talking easier to follow that his writing. I also believe that one could watch Mel Gibsons classic ""The Patriot"" and learn as much about the era and be finished learning in 2 hours.I am a teacher at famous language school in Japan and know a thing or too about teaching, and while this book is fine for the over-motivated historical enthusist, it is overdone for the general public. It is OK though, just don't expect alot of excitement."
A Good Sequel,"There are moments when you forget that this is a werewolf movie...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It usually would be, but GINGER SNAPS 2 - UNLEASHED nearly succeeds with becoming another different story: the surviving sister from the first movie finds herself in an institution, fighting her growing wolf tendencies (which the staff keeps mistaking for a drug addiction) and having visions of a full-blown werewolf coming for her.The characters have more substance to them than you usually find in horror movies. The writing keeps the story interesting, right up to the offbeat ending.Drawbacks? A little more atmosphere when the wolves show up would've made the special effects more effective. And the pretty girl from the first movie is reduced to dream-like cameos.Otherwise, an interesting and cool take on the werewolf movie. It's not the loud video game of the UNDERWORLD movies. But that's good."
Logitech 880 remote,I ourchased this product to replace three remotes. I was very pleased at the ease of setup and the over all operation of this remote. I would recommend this remote.
The bag was damaged in shipping,"This is a pretty good product if you are trying to eat a healthy diet, this is great. I decided to order it from amazon after reading a lot of great things about Maca powder.The package I received was beat up and dirty. Otherwise no complaints."
A water mess,"I got this for my b-day. First, I found this very hard to set up. It takes about 20 min. just to put the slides together. When I get the slides together, the pollys do not slide down, and instead, they fall off. The water overflows, so I'm still trying to dry off my room. Don't buy it, instead, just get a basic set of Polly Pockets."
Just so its clear,"Please note if you are considering buying that these are not the original movie soundtracks, these are an orchestra re-recording the music. If, like me, you like the original thing, then this is not for you."
Agreed; the description is wrong,I agree; the description is incorrect. I called to return this item about 10 times and MyClassroomSupplies never answered the phone.
Not recommended,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just die. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
NOT GOOD,"Couldn't finish watching this CG craptactular. I wanted to like this, like the comic, like sci-fi, this just didn't work. ..and the special effects, not good at all, maybe they were better in 3D but at home, terrible."
Light Duty,"Light duty extension pole. Not quite sturdy enough to hold an empty fruit picker, not going to try picking fruit with it. Read the description, it is LIGHT DUTY. May be good for cleaning spiderwebs up high."
1 star is almost too many...,"I've given up after about 100 pages. The only reason I made it that far was it was the only book I took with me on a weekend trip! I had nothing else to do on the plane and kept picking it up, reading another few pages until I couldn't stand it anymore, putting it down to stare at the seat in front of me, and then repeating the process out of boredom. I agree with other reviewers that it has a lot in common with Royal Tenenbaums, which is a movie that I love. Reading about insanely quirky, rich, self-absorbed characters just isn't as amusing. The writing was mostly bad, the little literary references and tricks were too obvious, the characters were unlikeable, and it all seemed very self-indulgent."
Nice opera.,"Interesting opera. If you like contemporary classical music this is for you. It includes the complete libretto. Note: ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is even better."
"Might work for others, but not me.","I was hoping to get stronger reception of my wireless signal from my E3000 router. I did see a very slight increase, although it was so small as to be useless. Perhaps with a direct line-of-sight it might work better, but not through 2 walls in my house. I am using powerline adapters instead of wireless now - much more reliable and faster when a wired ethernet port can be used."
Great product great price,"I knew very little about networking when I started installing this router. I was the cause of most of my problems. I now know much more about networking. Two windows XP computers share a cable access, a printer, files and after installing firmware 257 build 3 messenger runs in the DMZ without problems.I never spoke with anyone from d-link but they did respond to two emails within 24 hours each time. The router runs 8-12 hours each day without any problems. I would recommend this product."
f.uck epitaph,This is awful. About as punk as Kylie Minogue.The only band that can save epiatph records is Death by Stereo. And they arent even on this disc.Go to hell Gueruwitz and epitaph records
Sony Service Sucks,"Sony replaced an older es model of mine with this after my old one broke. It took Sony ""9 months"" to replace the receiver. After numerous calls to rude operators with no answers I finally threatened to sue. Only then did I get my replacement. My new receiver has been broken since i got it and am afraid to return it.Sony makes decent products but even the store where i bought the receiver says Sony has the worst customer service.If you want a throw away product buy a Sony but dont rely on their service.I will never buy Sony again."
meh,Not Tyler Perry's usual quality and intensity. Maybe if Madea would have actually put the girl's head into the toilet...
mouse didn't work - had to return it,"The feel of the mouse is good, but it won't work on either of our computers. It must be a lemon. I went ahead and ordered another from Dell, and will return this one."
Good song,"This is a really good song. I really like the Rolling Stones. Although, the only album I have is Forty Licks. They should make a Forty Licks two or something so we can get more of their great songs."
Good intro but needs more detail,"This book provides a good introduction to Active Directory for someone who is new to Windows 2000 server. The quality of writing is much better than what's found in most study guides. For the most part, what it covers is covered in a clear and understandable manner, but there are big gaps in what's covered. Also, I found a couple of really big factual errors.So I'd say, if you are new to Active directory, get this book, and read it quickly once over to get the concepts, but then put it down and find something else to really dig into the details of AD - Something such as the Distributed Systems Guide from the resource kit.One other thing, the binding on my copy broke and now the book is physically falling apart. And I didn't even use it very heavily."
undependable,Sometimes my fingerprint opens the computer and at other times it doesn't work at all. Overall it is very undependable. William Ray
Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix,"Overall a very good book, but I really thought it was not as good as book 3. It was not hard to figure out who was going todie and you kept asking yourself why the charactors were doing the things they were doing when there were alternatives for them to do. Also,it seems that Harry was angry all the time or feeling sorry for himself which does not play well. Also, she builds up the charactor of Neville and then he acts like a bumbling idiot again, why build him up in the first place? She leaves clues in her book that lead to nowhere. Just not as well thought out as I had hoped after all this wait."
So So,"The historic narrative was very interesting, but the parallel modern narrative was kind of illogical. Maybe some people do live the way the main character did in the story, but I doubt it."
An important historical perspective,"I read Hughes' Barcelona before I went to Barcelona for the first time, and it made all the difference in the world. I arrived not as a stranger, but as a student of Catalan culture and history. The book gave me the background to have an informed perspective on what I was seeing. It may be long, but it has tons of information. My only complaint is that Hughes assumes the reader has a knowledge of history that I, for one, don't have. So there were things I didn't understand.I liked that Hughes sometimes talked about the big things -- big events, important people, and he sometimes talked about the little things that make a place distinctive. His love of the place came through to me, and I fell in love with it too."
Coleman 2-Mantle Propane Lantern. (Not 'Instant Start' ),"Great lantern. Lightweight, well designed (except that the 'legs' tend to fall off the tank when you carry it. One other disappointment. I bought Coleman Lantern Lighters (Prod. # 503A) to install in each unit, only to find that this is one of the few Coleman lanterns that will not accomodate the lighter. That's a shame, as the lighter is a great convenience. Otherwise, I was pleased, and the recipients (they were Christmas gifts for teenage nephews) are very happy."
Insufficient Information,"I agree with the former two reviews appearing here. In all fairness, the ad format does not allow room for exhaustive technical information. With that in mind, it would have been wise of the seller to at least include a means of technical assistance for pre-purchase contact.... I could not find anything on the page that would allow me to make an informed decision about purchasing this item. Information revealing species type, application rate, and expected coverage area would have been helpful, not to mention a guarantee for live delivery... The ""number of units left"" information is NOT sufficient evidence for me to justify a $50.00 expenditure."
Wrong album art displayed,"Yo Amazon--You have the wrong CD on the page for this item. It's Sidney Torch music, and you have an Ibert album illustrating it."
Aload of ? !,"I bought thnking i waz in for a real good movie it turns out that i was wrong the movie is really poor,the characters have no good dialogue or background the only good thing to get out of these movie's is that Leatherface is cool to watch because a different person plays him in every movie and he get's slimer everytime and worse at the role but this was better than number two in the frightening way but i think people should think about renting before buying."
Works as advertised,These pads definitely beat applying drops of medicine as in years past. The only thing that I wish is that the pads came in smaller sizes.
Good for all ages,"I was pushed into this book by my wife, a 4th grade teacher, who wanted me to get into the series before going to see the movie. While used to reading mostly history and adult fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the story.Although I am not head-over-heels pumped to read the next volumes, I see how kids and adults alike can lose themselves in this fantasy, far-fecthed as it may be.I disagree with those who discount Potter on religious reasons because it supposedly sensationalizes occultism. There is more than just magic in this book. Kids can learn the lessons of trust and friendship, among others, Rowling weaves into this adventure."
NOT the Best Compilation,"Hossam Ramzy's numbers are great (that grand Classic ""AZIZA""...and Sahara Groove) but the rest werenot up to the expectations generated by the title..even though there were many very well-known & respected names....yes...THe BEST of that .... but the numbers themselves were not very inspiring.Perhaps it is just my viewpoint from my ""non-Middle Eastern ears"". It's not a CD I frequently use..either for dancing or listening."
The Best!,My favorite chocolate - it's wonderful rich chocolate with a hint of lavander...it always is a treat to enjoy!
not quite accurate though correct,not in a 2-pack but was two separate packages of slightly different vintage though correct model number
what happened to them??,"i used to love staind, for their music, and mostly for their lyrics. dysfunction and torment were excellent. i was so excited about the new album, and i got it, and i was so dissapointned. the best song on the cd is 'fade'. the rest of it is just contrived 'i'm so depressed..give me money' . now all the teenyboppers are going to buy the earlier albums and try to say 'they know what aaron's lyrics are talking about'. when they obviously don't in their popular, ambercrombie little lives. they are ultimately what ruined staind."
Keeps you busy!,So many designs to look at and get ideas from! Good price here. Always good to subscribe to a magazine and receive these surprises in the mail every month!
"NICE DESIGN, full mask would be better though.","I think this is a neat mask, because the design is good and you can tell it's supposed to resemble the rapper Tupac as soon as you look at it. When I got the mask, it was a bit mashed up during shipping, but I was satisfied when it returned to it's natural shape after hanging for a few days. I'm happy with the mask, but I wish it was a full mask that went all the way around the head and face...this one doesn't, it has a strap in the back. I recommend it though."
Good Fight scenes,"I saw this movie on my trip to china over the summer. I read an article in the newspaper, and it got horrible review over there for many reasons. I won't give away the ending, but i know that myself, and the rest of the audience had a good laugh at it when it should have been dramatic and anything but funny. I have to say that i cant rate this movie on its entirety because when i saw it it was in chinese with chiense subtitles, and my knowledge of both is extremely limited, so i wont give it lower then a three for that reason. If you are looking for fight scenes, then this movie is great, but dont expect a real tear jerker, its just too funny."
"Good deal, and a great product.","I had been beating my self up useing my old wood rasps. They were dull and the handles were missing. Usualy if I am going to buy on line I go to Amazon. These look and sounded like they would do the job. Now that I have used them, they feel great in my hand, and cut quickly with less effort."
WCW Bash at the Beach 2000 review,"The Lt.Loco-Juventu Guerrera-Cruiserweight title match was a basic,solid,high-flying match. The Big Vito-Norman Smiley & Ralphus Handicap match for the Hardcore title was ok for a hardcore title match. The Daffney-Ms.Hancock-Wedding Gown match was a dumb mindless filler. The Kronik-Perfect Event-World Tag Team title match was a basic,solid tag team bout. The Kanyon-Booker T match was not great but pretty good. The Scott Steiner-Mike Awesome-U.S title match was a good match ruined by a lousy DQ ending. The Vampiro-KISS Demon-Graveyard match was a down & dirty but somewhat boring brawl. The Shane Douglas-Buff Bagwell match was a pretty solid brawl. The Hulk Hogan-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was nothing more then a lazy,dumb,BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT. The Goldberg-Kevin Nash match was slow but still pretty good in some ways. The Booker T-Jeff Jarrett-World title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,smash-mouth brawl. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10."
4.5 STARS...............,"Once I began reading this book I could not stop. It is the kind of book you are reluctant to put down and cannot wait to pick up again. This book will make you laugh out loud and then move you to tears all in the same paragraph. The chemistry between Matt and Meredith is undeniable; it is almost painful to read the scenes when they are apart. Matt's character is very cavalier, bold, and aggressive whereas Meredith is quite the opposite. Luckily, they mesh well even though Meredith's naivety can get frustrating.My only complaint would be that I thought some parts of the novel were drawn out. I also felt that after about of the way into the story the plot suddenly seemed to be rushed (particularly after Meredith's birthday party).I bought this book based on reviewers' recommendations and I'm very pleased I did."
THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!!,"One of my favorite books: I just rented this movie (THANK GOD I didn't waste more money and BUY it!!) and I was soooo disappointed. All the hype - and for what? I don't get why this is being called ""A cult classic""? Maybe for those who need to get a life... (Okay - so it was ""first of it's kind"" with some of the language and a couple of ""scandalous"" scenes). REALLY, REALLY (and I do mean REALLY!!) poor acting/poor songs/singing/ and didn't even follow the true storyline of the book! A sad waste of time!!! I'd give it half a star if it was available!"
broke after one week.,"cutting to the chase- the scroll wheel did not work after a few days of use. I sent it back for a refund.two stars because when it worked, it was awesome. I needed very little movement to reach the extremities of the screen. The problem (as mentioned) was the wheel. The mouse itself was very light and very cheap feeling. I would suggest going for one of the 8 dollar mini mice vs. this $15 one.ohh... and the case is garbage also. there wasn't anything redeeming about it so don't let it sway you in your purchase decision.****update****i returned it for a refund. amazon.com has an awesome policy."
not only the beach boys....................,people seem to forget how in tune to music and other artists that elton was. not only are the beach boys on backing vocals but the TOWER OF POWER horn section did all the brass back ups; elton even took them out on his tour with him to support this album.i rate this album a 3 only because in 1974 and living in FORT LAUDERDALE; radio station WSHE would play SICK CITY over an over from SUN single before the album was released. man i was upset when the album came out and SICK CITY was not on the album. all in all this album still holds up well.
At least the DVD works...,I guess you get what you pay for. I expected to get a the Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition packaging (the dvd box is a special two disc case) when I ordered this but what I got was the two disc set in a cheap recycled blockbuster case with the original sleeve insert cut down to fit inside the slimmer case. If you've bought the other Special Collector editions you know the dvd case is different. At least the DVD's work.
God's music uplifts the spirit,"His special music uplifts the spirit - always and in all ways. This is a wonderful 2 disc set that surrounds us in a sacred atmosphere. Like a sprinkle of rain on a sunny day, the sampling of favorite hymns refreshes and enlivens the heart."
need directions,Bought as a gift for my running daughter. Directions are challenging and she's not thrilled with the color...
Excellent Docudrama Concerning the AV 1611,Even if you don't view the King James Bible as the word of God this is still an excellent and well made docudrama for those interested in the history one of the most important pieces of literature in Western Civilization. Beautifully filmed on location in Scotland and England and presented by the magnificent voice actor John Rhys-Davies.
Master Lock 2837ATSC Hitch Ball Mount,"Master Lock 2837ATSC Hitch Ball Mount...Very well made, quality product. The shipping charge was >$6.00. I expected it to be have the, ""No Spin"" feature as advertised, but I was unpleasantly surprised that it did not."
"I like it, but for the wrong reasons.","Whats great about Vick's Vapo Inhalers are that they smell nice, are a little soothing, and they easily fit in any pocket.The problem however is that they can't and/or don't work the way I expect them to.A stuffy nose is due to swollen membranes in the nasal cavity. If you're COMPLETELY stuffed up, then you can't even inhale the product through your nostrils to work. This is flaw #1 as you can't use a nasal product if you can't even breathe in or out of your nose.The 2nd reason for me that I'm not impressed by the product is that if I'm only partially stuffy, the product DOES NOT reduce any inflammation at all, at least not in me, and even if it could, the effect is only temporary on levels of only a few seconds. Not even a minute later, I'd be right back to stuffy levels.I like the product because of it's portability and smell and may buy it again because of that, but its not any solution to my nasal congestion problems."
"Good, if you like the style of music.","I bought Orgy's CD because I liked their songs ""Blue Monday"" and ""Stitches."" At first I wasn't sure if I really liked the other songs, but then they grew on me. Techno style of music that I don't hear to often. Job well done. Be warned, do not buy this CD unless you like hard rock/techno garage music that sometimes gives you a headache if you listen to it too much."
Easy to us.,"We bought this to help determine if there was anything in our well water to be concerned with (fortunately, our water was good). This test was very easy to use. Just follow the directions and read the results!"
The band Sublime is not a classic and neither is this CD,"What kind of garbage is this? The beats sound like they are copied off of other ska bands like No Doubt, Sugar Ray and others. Eventhough Sublime came before Limp Bizkit and Sugar Ray, I would rather buy Sugar Ray than this Jamaican beats ripoff. The lead singer died of cocaine overdose in 1996 and that shows that Jamaican/ska bands like Sublime can be gone in a blink of an eye. Sublime tries to rap in Bob Marley style beats, but it fails miserably. The lead singer sounds like he sung in a styrofoam cup. Everbody thinks this band is a classic while it lasted, but this CD is just a headache for the ears. They think they're so cool, they rap about the LA riots in 1992. Big deal. I know Sublime had released four CD's before this last CD, but all of their albums are just cardboard. This bands' last CD is not a classic at all."
Outstanding,"This book was totally awesome. It deals with magic, but it also has a fair amount of realness and fun to it too. The story twists through plots and the totally unexpected happens, keeping a reader on the edge of their seat. The exciting adventures are all origional and fun to read, with a drop of romance mixed into the plots. The Realms of the Gods is a really fun book to read."
Don't throw your TV set out the window!,"I'm glad to see SCTV finally out on DVD but why this season? The NBC stuff just wasn't as funny as their earlier shows. I guess it's because these are the episodes that are most familiar to American audiences but the show went from the core members in the early days writing a lot of funny, original stuff to having a bunch of writers and the comedy being stretched thinner over the 90 minute long episodes appearing each week. There is still a lot of great moments but the NBC run was really the lowest. That being said, I'm looking forward to rhe rest of the DVD releases, I might not buy them all but I still want to support them in the hopes of releasing the funny and original first season and strange, quirky last season of the non-NBC series, both of which contain the best content."
u get what u pay for,It isn't a zune product like it shows which would be ok if it hadn't fell apart. It Works ok but the part that connects to my zune fell apart exposing the wires.
AMAZING,"What an amazing book. There is just volumes of tips, info and jobs that I didn't even know were out there. With this book, I know that I will have the knowledge that's needed to land a federal job.If you want to be in a federal position, this is THE BOOK for you. I carry it around everyone...can't put it down."
Great Teen Vampire Book,"Sixteen-year-old Kerry Nowicki saves the life of a vampire (Ethan Bryne) one night when she stumbles upon a group of vampire hunters bullying him in a Brockport, New York, laundromat. Consequently, she becomes involved in his life when the remaining vampire hunter abducts Kerry's father and 4-year-old brother (Ian) and later kills Ethan's vampire friend (Regina Sloane). Together they spend a great deal of the book driving around in stolen cars, looking for her missing family and a lone vampire hunter whose work isn't finished yet.""Companions of the Night"" is a well-written, exciting book that's hard to put down. There's plenty of action and suspense, with some sparring romance between Kerry and Ethan (though I found Ethan much too manipulative and evasive to be a satisfying heartthrob), which should appeal to vampire fans of all ages."
What bad performance,"I enjoyed the book. I looked forward to the movie. But, what a disapointment! ZiYi Zhang is nothing but a zombie with lots of make-up. The acting is terrible! We could even tell she was TRYING to act the character. My husband could not follow the movie, got so bored, and left."
My all-time favorite!,"I bought this book in the 5th grade and was absolutely mesmerized by it. Over the past 15 years I have read it over and over again and have appreciated it on a different level each time as I, too, have grown-up with the lead character of ""Francie"". If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War. I cannot recommend it enough and the movie truly does not do it any justice. A must-read for all ages!"
Dirty but working,"I must confess that I do not actually have the game system because it was a gift for my older sister. However, I asked her to let me know how it was so I could write a review. She told me that you could tell it was used because of a crack and that it was really dirty! But it still works, which is the most important part."
Turning Stones,"The book 'Turning Stones' was a very well written book. The book was very discriptive and very well stated. This book made me realize how much child abuse is a very common thing. The book was very disterbing at times, but all that needed to be said was said. I dont think anyone could have said these things better than the way Marc Parent put them. the book made me look at child services diferently. it made me realize that they were trying to do some good in the world. they are trying to save lives of innocent childrent that adults were just throwing away. I feel that everyone should read this book so that they can see what a child goes throw, either through there eyes or the eyes of another. I feel this book will be around to help stop child abuse until it is controled and eliminated. Thank you Marc Parent"
Well...,"The bristles are way too soft for it to be of any exfoliation benefit. I'm very disappointed as far as that goes. I use it mainly for scrubbing in my daily cleanser, and it's nice for that, and my face does feel cleaner after using it that way."
Great for Administrative Staff,"Had looked for two months for a book for my staff to learn how to administer AD objects. This book covered both the history, fundamentals and how-to without digging to the level that they do not have any experience with.Would highly recommend to anyone that is starting out their AD experience by only administering objects."
Not recognized,"DOES NOT work with an HTC Excalibur...at least not with mine. It recognizes the 1gb version just fine, but not his one. The 4gb is recognizable by my computer, but not my phone, which is what i bought it for. i am disappointed."
"Same authors, different pen names.","Imagine you are Ron Louis and David Copeland. You have written the book ""How to Succeed With Women."" Now you want to make more money. So you write a contracted version of the first book and publish it under another name.In this book (The Rules FGL), the authors provide an email address for questions--they promise personal answers. I wrote them. I got an answer from RonL at howtosucceedwithwomen.com!What a scam.I also got automatically added to their mailing list, and got no personal answer!The book is okay, but contains almost the same information as ""How To Succeed With Women,"" but lots less detail."
No effect,"Frankly, these supplements are highly variable in their effectiveness. I have an RSI injury and bad knees, taking this daily for two weeks has yielded no benefit. For the high cost, this is not worth it."
Few Worthy Tracks,Stand-out tracks:3. Welcome (3/5)8. Foolin (5/5)11. The Right Way (4/5)14. Street Chronicles (5/5)
Waste of Time and Money,"I would caution anyone not to waste valuable resources on this book. And do not listen to the ""get it while it's publicly available"" nonsense either. You could probably get a manual on nuclear reactors too, but it wouldn't mean you could teach yourself to run one and it wouldn't make you a nuclear physicist. If you really want a Gardnerian or Alexandrian BOS, contact a legit coven and get yours the old-fasioned way, earn it. You can buy this book, and even learn it by heart word-for-word, but it will not make you Gardnerian or Alexandrian. Wicca is lineaged and experiential. You can't get it solely from a book. Even if a legit Gardnerian or Alexandrian HP/HPS handed you their BOS, it's not enough. There is much more to it. Too bad there is a one star minimum."
Not worth buying,This is the worse possible rabbit hutch to buy. Ours began to fall apart not even after a year. Called the Ware company and they would not do anything
One book to rule them all ...,"One story all encompassing ..One quest for life or death ..One supreme evil, one chaotic good..Who among you could put down this book, even as Sleep crept up and tugged at your minds?One Ring To Rule Them All! One Ring To Bind Them!This is and always shall be the greatest fantasy epic ever written, to be read and enjoyed by anyone of any age. There is book enough for 15 year old and 50 year old alike."
Where's the beef!?,"This book is pretty weak. I agree that our president is an immoral man, but this book doesn't contain any meat! ADDICTION IN THE WHITE HOUSE consistently states well-known facts, or it draws conclusions which are not really made clear and don't always seem to make sense. I'd never heard of Canyon Adams before, and his book was a poor choice of purchase on my part."
Available,"This album is available (as of Sept. 2010) on iTunes for $5.99 under the title ""Hallelujah."" I'm not sure why you can't get it from Amazon.com."
"Engaging and Informative, But Ultimately Disappointing","Cahill is always a good read, and there is some new information and thinking here, but for Christ's sake this series is called ""Hinges of History"" and the subtitle to the book is ""The World Before and After Jesus."" There is little if anything here about either of these issues -- C'mon Cahill, is the world different after Jesus? How? Why? Those are huge questions, sure, but it is a little disappointing that Cahill never manages even to brush up against them in the entire book. Still, a good read if only because of Cahill's engaging style.On last issue. I am a Christian, and I have no idea why any Christian would not like this book or should be afraid of it, as some of the other commentators seem to be."
This scale is crrrap and only worked about 3 times before dying,"I bought this scale only a week ago at Target and it worked about 3 times in a row right after I got it home. Then the next weekend I tried to use it again, and it just wheels through all kinds of values (none close to reality) and stops with dashes across it. I thought perhaps it was the battery had been on the shelf too long, so I bought some new batteries for it today (got some extras) but it worked exactly the same way with a new battery!Just like others, I got led to this scale from the glowing rating by Consumer Reports but they must make them in the cheapest factory in China, and I'm not impressed.I will likely return it for a full refund, and will look at other brands now. Good thing I kept my receipt and it failed in 1 week after purchase.Buyer beware!"

In the end reader will be encouraged to ""Let things go and let God""..."
unworthy sequel,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is not very good in my opinion. The plot gets cheesy and very unrealistic to the point of boredum. I only give this movie a second star because the first part of the movie holds your interest to a certain point. You won't miss out on anything by not watching this film.
not much to say but a beautifull case,"This is an impressive case for the money, very solid and well manufactured it looks killer in comparisson with my other guitar cases. the only thing I don't like is the weigth. cause this case it's like a stone."
Broken in Shipping,"I think the grill would have been good if it hadn't been broken when I got it. And of course they were all sold out, so I had to get a refund."
Eternal,"As the name says itself ETERNAL- by using this cream you can keep your skin young and beautiful for years! After applying it, you can feel this cream working on your skin, repairing, nourishing, making your skin looking radiant. I love this product, I'll use it forever!"
print saving type set,I read this book previously when it was in a bold type face and easy on the eyes. This paperback edition has money saving print type face and not so easy to read without good lighting and in my case a magnifying glass. I was a little disappointed but the material is worth reading and remembering.
Head Splitting,"Clark's novel is a dramatic failure of literature and artistry.What isn't contrived, misogynistic, or overindulged verbalacrobatics, is a plot line that fails to pull the readerforward, and characters that are hard for readers to care about.The concern in the work is not to tell a good story, but to display an intellectual prowess that is neither interestingor useful in the novel."
I loved it!,"I've always loved Hikki, but that isn't the reason why i loved this album. It's so unique! It's a bummer it didn't make it in the US. I think if Hikki can balence her good lyrics and japanese music that she writes she can make it here!!"
"Historic plane, fun winter project.","After watching Jimmy Stewart in the movie ""Spirit of St. Louis"", I decided I wanted to build a flying balsa-wood model as a winter project. It was easy to find and order on Amazon.Com. It arrived quickly and I am delighted with the kit. It will test my limited experience with balsa-wood models but the drawings and instructions seem very complete. Thanks to Amazon and the supplier, both were very helpful."
"Actually, 3 and a half stars","I dearly love this great opera, which I consider one of the pinnacles of French music. It's a tough one to pull off for many reasons, and all of the six or seven versions I've heard have weaknesses in one area or another.My benchmark for Les Troyens is the gorgeous love duet """"Nuits d'ivresse"" in Act 4. The singing here is very good, but Pretre conducts it much too quickly and spoils the whole effect. The piece should flow, throbbing with both erotic ardor and erotic lassitude as it unfolds. Here it just sounds rushed. And speeds are bit bit brisk throughout. My all-time favorite for this duet is sung by Regine Crespin and Guy Chauvet on a 2-LP abridged set from the early 1960s, oddly enough also conducted by Pretre. Perhaps La Crespin fixed him with a steely glare and said ""Slow down, Georges!"" Nonethless there are many worthy moments in this recording, particularly when drama is required."
save your money,"After 5 years of Taekwondo, I was looking for something to take me to the next level. I was very disappointed with this video. If you have been doing any form of martial arts for longer than 2 weeks, save your money... you already know as much as this video will teach you."
I wouldn't recommend it,"It has some good facts about human psychology in it but after a few chapters it just was hogwash. The title makes you want to read it, not what I expected."
Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for my brother, and was not aware that this isn't a typical edition, but an apparently cheaply published one. The book is a big, floppy paperback--not what I expect when ordering a novel, and not what I would consider gift material. Besides this, no complaints."
The Sight- Now one of my all-time favorites!,"I read this book because I saw that it was by the same author as Fire Bringer, and loved it! This intelligent tale of a wolf pack struggling to overcome a fearful curse, is a tale of love, betrayal, hate, and plenty of irony. I won't say anything else about the story, because that would destroy the many surprises that this author has in store for you."
Stock footage with New Age music.,"I too enjoy the sound of 50,000 pounds of thrust screaming with the afterburner lit. Unfortunately you will only hear one fly by during the intro of the DVD. The music, while well performed is almost too restful, especially when you see an aviator sitting in the cockpit of an aircraft capable of Mach 2.5. The video quality was a little grainy, mainly because a lot of the footage was shot a long time ago.While some shots were quite unique, most were right from Discover Wings. This is ""nice"" for your aviation collection but not the edge of your seat DVD you might be expecting."
Misleading Title,"These songs/artists are no more the godfathers of grunge than I am the King of England. A feeble attempt at jumping on the grunge bandwagon and claiming to have someting to do with it's origins. Great songs nonetheless, but a stupid title for a classic rock album."
Good for Getting Your Getting Your Feet Wet,I found this book quite slow but it is quite good for the begining programer who knows nothing about programing. It's also a little funny.
Fun look at the Arthurian legend,"Those well-versed with Arthurian legend know of Lancelot, and he is one of the primary characters in this film. it is a unique look at the legends of Camelot and the dynamics between Arthur, Lancelot, and the beautiful Guinevere. Sean Connery makes a great Arthur, and this is a good movie, though it may be a bit slow-paced at times."
WORST RZA CD EVER!!!,"THIS IS NOT A GREAT CD FROM THE RZA WHO USUALLY IS ON POINT WITH THE LYRICS AND PRODUCTION MOST OF THE SONGS SOUNDS TO MAINSTREAM AND ALOT OF WACKASS GUEST APPEARANCES GRITS WUZ THE GREATEST SONG ON THE CD RZA SOUNDS A WHOLE LOT BETTER ON THE WU CD'S I DONT THINK HES A GREAT SOLO ARTIST BUT DIGITAL BULLETS IS THE ONLY SOLO I LIKE FROM HIM, ANYWAYS THIS CD GAVE ME A HEADACHE AND MAJORITY OF IT IS GARBAGE TO ME SO DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS."
Very comfortable and warm!,"I use it to a regular twin size mattress in dormitary. It fits very well and give nicely sleep.It's very soft, not as hard as I first saw it. Makes my dormitory more like home."
Good Pictures but the way it is layed out is just ok,This would be a very nice book if you are a parent who will be reading it to a younger kid who cannot read very well yet. Otherwise the reading is more at a teenage level at least.The pictures and graphical things are very good! Some of the more advanced rules are a little confusing.
Don't buy these for use on tile floors,"I needed sliders for my kitchen table which, due to space limitations, has to be moved almost daily. Unfortunately, instead of making the job easier, they make it harder. Maybe they would work better on carpeted areas. I wish the descriptions would be a little more specific."
DONNA SUMMER XMAS,"DONNA SUMMER HAS SUCH A GOOD VOICE, WHY WOULD SHE MAKE SUCH A MESS OF THE BEAUTIFUL O HOLY NIGHT,IT WAS TERRIBLE,"
My two cats really enjoy the Au Jus cans,"Unlike the previous reviewer, my cats like the Au Jus cans. They enjoy the chicken, turkey, rabbit and duck flavors. I like to feed my cats a high-protein diet to keep them trim, and this food helps me reach that goal.The only reason I'm giving the food 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't feed it alone. It doesn't have the vitamins cats need as a standalone food. It's good for a meal a few times a week or top-dressed with supplements. I also wish the Au Jus varieties came in the smaller cans. It's hard for 2 cats to go through a huge can in a couple of days.If you're feeding your cats grocery store foods, they probably won't like this. If they're used to eating premium foods and occasional raw meat like mine are, they should take to this food with no problem."
How much do I hate thee.....let me count the ways.,"This CD is so bad that I want to limit my words I use to describe this. All I am going to say is that if I had to choose between listening to this CD or being bald, I would invest in hats."
"Sorry to say,,,it was a bust.","Nothing to do with the seller. Product arrived on time and was well packaged...the product, on the other hand, sucks. Bought it to store lettuce but I did not realize I was buying a ""towel with a drawstring"". Could have made one myself...and, it pulled all the moisture out of my lettuce making the salad extremely dry and uneatable. My husband now uses it to transport his Ball Pythons since it wasn't worth the trouble to return it...back to my ziplock and paper towels."
"A GOOD POP FILTER, BUT DANGEROUS !!!","It does a great job as far as handling your pop and pushing the direction downward, but, it has a design flaw in my opinion. I took some duct tape to try to cover the raw edge that may cut some ones face if you become distracted, I'm searching for a more attractive solution to that problem. This products flexible placement arm is too weak, that makes it hard to stay in place, I cut a hanger and inserted it within the tube of the flexible arm to try and strengthen it. Depend on the temperature of the room, the duct tape doesn't stick very well, or, very long."
I'm sure I know these people...,"Laisha Rosnau does a wonderful job of evoking real small-town life in this first novel. I grew up in a town much like that where the book is set, and reading this novel was like reliving my adolescence (wait, maybe that's not so good). The story centres on the lives of conflicted small town teenagers, but we also get to know the bizarre but all-too-real adults that influence their lives. A very satifying read that made me laugh, and made me remember why I moved away."
Venom:Metal Black,"I really hate to give one my favorite bands a mediocre review.But this is the first venom album that didn't keep my attention.It certainly isn't their best nor a successor to welcome to hell, black metal,or war with satan.Which i originally had hopes for,considering the albums title.These tracks are in my opinion are the cream of the top.1.Antechrist5.Rege Satanas6.Darkest Realm8.AssassinTheir prior album ""Resurrection"" is far more powerful.If your a ""DIE HARD"" (pun intended) venom fan its a must have.Just dont expect the coming of the ""Antechrist"" (puns just roll out,sorry) while listening to it"
"A film i've looked forward to, but...","- Couldnt expect much, but the movie was a fun ride. Unlike the previous entries in the serie, Terminator 3 entertains us with its witty humor and none stop action sequences. I liked the movie, i liked it a lot. But, i did not love it! JUDGEMENT DAY is still the no.1 Terminator film to me, but Terminator 3 proves that a movie doesnt need a VERY rich plot to entertain audiances. Course, movies need plot, but this movie managed to entertain the entire theater i was in. However, if you are looking for a movie with a more depth and a plot, then look elsewhere, T3 is a one and a half hour fun ride with action, special effects, guns & glory, chases and explosions. And all in good humor. O'course i know people would dissagree with my rank for this movie, but since it wasent as good as it could have been, i have to recomment people to rent the movie before buying."
"Good size, okay light","Bought this to keep in my coat, so it suits the job. Small enough that it goes unnoticed, and the light is decent enough to work in a pinch. I just with that it packed a bit more of a punch."
"Shipping took a while, but otherwise ok.","My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal. These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack. It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.I do like having them shipped to me. That's nice. Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place. I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping. I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping. We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep."
YES!!! FINALLY!,"This has to be the greatest and most classic non-animated show ever to be on TV. I mean, let's face it TV these days is pretty pathetic with the exception of The Simpsons, King Of The Hill, and Family Guy which was unfortunately cancelled well before its time.But What's Happening was a fantastic show with some of the greatest characters ever! It's hard not to smile just thinking about some of the greatest moments on that show.I just hope the DVD has some good extras. I would love to see some recent interviews with the cast to see what they are up to and what has become of them since the show (except for Fred ""Rerun"" Barry, God rest his soul).Either way, this classic TV show is worth having in any comedy lover's collection."
Warning,"This book about the founding of the USA is laced with anti-Bush diatribes. This is more political commentary than history. If this is what you are expecting, then you should enjoy this book."
"Noisey, but cleans the air.","I really like air cleaners but this model is very noisey. If I use it in the living room it makes it hard to hear the TV. It does a great job keeping down the dust in the air. Nothing beats a Hepa filter, but i wish it was quieter."
Nerve Endings used book,"The wrong book was sent, and this book never arrived. I read a library copy instead, and the company refunded the money. They were very cooperative, and I will order from them again."
Melancholy gem,"Whistling along with these sad tunes for the thousandth time ... This little-known album is pleasure made of twisted tango and beautiful bandoneon (plus piano, violin, guitar and bass)."
A disappointment,"The first two songs are great, but the rest of the CD is completely and totally forgettable. I was disappointed. Shania's lyrics get more and more mundane with each new album."
Breaks easily.,"I bought two of these. I gave one to my brother, and kept one on my keyring. I tend to be a bit hard on my keyring, but this thing starting having trouble after about a month. Its construction is a bit cheap."
Clunky clamps,These clamps are kinda flimsy-probably why they are cheap. Table edge must be exact size of the clamp or it doesn't work well. What are the odds of all tables being the same size?
Brothers in Arms Novel,"Good Book. A little weak in some action on the ""Killers from Holland"". I'd like to see more of them in the future. But, overall I enjoyed the book and would buy the next one without hesitation."
young readers/teenagers books - poor availability,"I bought this specifically for my 12-yo son to use. He is an avid reader, loves technology - so I thought, excellent present, combine the 2 and he'll be even happier to read.The problem I'm finding is the lack of books available for his age group - and not one of his favourite writers is available through kindle. Rather disappointing - but hopefully not forever.."
Dead after less than a year!,The title says it all: Bought 8 of them at Target less than a year ago. Now they are kind of dead: They would keep their charge for not more than a couple of days and then they go dead immediately. My SB-600 Flash wouldn't even work with a fresh charged load after recycling (the flash charge) for 3-4 times. After doing some research I only buy Sanyo Eneloop. They haven't let me down yet.
Good thing to pass on to struggling parents,We reviewed this program before we sent it to our daughter and son in law. If this doesn't help them we don't know what will. We bought it because we wanted them to hear the message about consistency from someone else. The program is quite clear and well presented.
Tropic Thunder Unrated Director's Cut,"This product was exactly what I ordered, widescreen and everything, and it arrived within a few days brand spanking new."
No Size in the ad !,"If the size (i.e. what model it fits) is not included in the ad, I'd never buy this. Shipping stuff back and forth is not THAT much fun."
Moving voice for so many that suffered,"This book leaves me feeling heavy with sadness, Miss Fuji who seemed to have lived a whole lifetime without getting to really live one day. Disease is powerful, human fear is more so. I am glad I read the Pearl Diver, being one of those books that makes you happy for the life you have and maybe appreciate it just a little bit more than you did before."
"Works only so-so, good physical layout for my needs.","It's inexpensive, hasn't caught fire, and has protected our equipment so far. Sometimes turning a space heater on or off will cause my television to blank out for a second. Both are plugged in to the UPS.[NEW EDIT 3/2012] I've had this over a year now, and recently a power fluctuation caused the lights to flicker, but it caused my computer to shut down. The UPS should have handled this flicker without powering down the computer. Lowing review from three to two stars."
Probably not smart to order in the summertime,"I love this product and have been ordering it for several months. Just got my latest order and the contents were melted and it had leaked all over the box. Not a big deal, but it was super messy and we lost some contents of the jar. Try and order during the cold months and not when it sits in the 90 degree weather in ups trucks."
Caveat Emptor,"Clearly Blow Fly left a lot to be desired..........especially in light of the fact that the author is quite capable of delivering more to her readers. Rather than focusing on an authentic, scientific approach to the storyline, Ms. Cornwell uses her descriptive expertise to develop character after character - some of whom have little if any real role in the novel. In essence, the tedious nature of the latter leaves the reader unquestionably bored. Lending to that (and a BIG yawn here) is the disastrous manner in which she finalizes the story beginning with the ""Wolfman's"" jail break. If I wanted to read comic books, I would buy them. The incredulous events in her final pages leave one to ponder whether the author intended this novel for individuals who were challenged with exceptionally low IQs. Given her remarkable talent for writing, Blow Fly is definitely NOT her best effort. Sadly, it is an insult to the intelligence."
Frustrated with Grainy Indoor Shots,"I purchased this camera, because my 5mp Kodak's flash did not carry very far indoors (which made zooming indoors a lost cause)The s700 is much better in that area--the flash carries up to 15-20 feet, but the final results are grainy and disappointing.Outdoor pix are fabulous with the s700, but I have found that the majority of photos I shoot are indoors, and this 7mp camera can't hold a candle to the quality of the older 5mp Kodak that I have.Now, if I can just get the finishing quality of the Kodak with the flash capabilities of the s700 . . ."
May be NOT!,"This film lacked all of the attributes of a good horror film. When I wasn't laughing at the inane dialogue and story line, I was in constant battle of pushing the off button on the remote.Yes, I'm sure the sociable May would attract many potential friends. Who wouldn't want to befriend an emaciated frazzle-haired psycho with tics? Exactly......Call me crazy, but if I saw this girl on a bench I would avoid her at all costs.It also missed its ultimate objective which was to stir empathy for the lonely May. If you want to see a good film that executes this masterly, I recommend ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"""
Don't Miss These Great Vocal Hits,"It took me a long while to decide to get this CD, because I suspected that vocal lounge music would be too schmaltzy--that is, would lack the punch of the instrumental stuff on the other CDs. When I finally decided to get it (after reading the other reviews here), I was very pleasantly surprised. The highlights include ""Charade"", ""Angel Eyes"", ""It Had Better Be Tonight"" (one of the three bonus tracks), and, best of all, the two tracks by Louis Prima (Oooohhh-Aaaaaahhh!)."
Good Score,"I liked this book, I am really hockey fan so it make the book more of exciting. I liked how Jane stuck her guns and worked as the reporter in the story.. As much as I liked this book, I did like Body Check and Fair Play in turns of sports and romance."
Pictures in the center of the book.,"I's like this book a lot more if the all the tree photos were adjacent to the text description, instead of all the pictures being concentrated in the center of the book."
A wonderful book for children of the world,"This book is a great way for children to be introduced to Japan and some of its charm. As a parent, when our daughters were young, my wife and I got books of stories and songs from all over the world for them. Not only do the songs resonate with children, but they are wonderful way to introduce the ""World"" to young people - rather than only on the news. Through music we understand the ""sameness"" that we share. This book was purchased for a grandchild as a way to begin the process of taking him by the hand into this wonderful world."
It trims,Its compact and works well in tight spaces. I wish it were waterproof though.... that would make clean up easier.
An Ok additional story for Dr. Who,This is an OK story for Dr Who. I assume it was considered too expensive for film so they used animation instead.The main problem is that animation forces actors to over act a bit and the actors are already very expressive so the voices just go over the top.The animation style is great though.
Don't Tell everything that Happens!,hi i would like to say that one person before wrote bout jessica coming i haven't read the book yet so it ruins it for me i may still get the book but next time please don't ruin it for others
TurboTax 2005,I have used TurboTax since I retired over 10 years ago. Before that I had always used a tax accountant to do my taxes. After using TurboTax for 4 or 5 years my doubting wife felt we should have the tax accountant review our tax return done using TurboTax. He found no errors and had no additional suggestions. For years I have been a Beta tester and each year there are improvements to the previous year's program that I had thought couldn't be improved upon. One year I used a less expensive tax program and quickly found that to be a big mistake. I highly recommend TurboTax.
Marvelous for childeren,This is a marvelous book for people of all ages but I highly recomend it for childeren. The stories are intriging and incourage reading. If you love autobiographys and biographys you'll love this book
"Raises my ""cool"" factor, use it all the time","Great item, only would be nice if it had password protection and wifi/bluetooth"
FBA,I was able to read this in one sitting from start to finish and it gave me all the necessary information on Functional Behavioral Analysis I could need.
J Lo fails,"Jennifer Lopez had her 15 minutes of fame, now it is time to move on. this set of songs does not do it."
"Family fun, done right!",Thanks Disney for releasing this movie on DVD. Thanks for putting it out in the proper ratio. Thanks for adding nice bonus features. Thanks all around. This movie was a special part of my childhood. I can still remember watching my dear dad laughing at this delightful movie.
Terrible,"This tastes like scorched artificial butterscotch flavoring. If artificial sweeteners taste bitter to you, as they do to me, don't buy it. I'd read such positive things about Da Vinci syrups but this is my first and last bottle."
A book full of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories,"That Tesla was a great scientist and inventor I won't argue. However, this book isn't about that Tesla. Instead, it leverages off the fact that he could be a bit eccentric and uses some of his crazier ideas to push pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. For those who enjoy well-written English, the book's many grammatical and punctuation errors will likely be quite painful - it was obviously not professionally edited."
Where is the director's cut?,"When this show was released on VHS in 1994 it was a ""Director's Cut"". which had added scenes and was 110 minutes in length. The version released on DVD is only 92 minutes long. Couldn't Warner Brothers have at least released the longer version of this show?"
Worked the first time!!!,"This monitor is fabulous! I used it once- for a month- and got pregnant. Two of my friends had the same results, just one cycle and boom, pregnant. If you have been trying w/o luck, definitely worth the money! I plan to use it again when our baby is a little older for baby #2. GOOD LUCK!"
unfair review or my opinion,"since season 2 just debuted on hbo recently me and girlfriend decided to start watching season 1.we both have varying opinions on movie selections she leans more to romantic comedies and I tend to watch asian crime drama.we both did not like this show. we thought it was slow, all of the characters are not interesting I don't care for their personal stories or the main plot/story.to be fair, i must say we decided to stop watching after episode 5 in a 10 episode season."
Awesome,"Great book, from a great author. I really enjoyed it. If you enjoy reading about and experiencing these exciting times, you'll love this book."
NOT for strong chewers,My 20 lb miniature pincher ate through this toy in 10 minutes. Do not get this for a dog who likes to chew. I've had much better luck with the hard plastic food puzzle toys. The ball itself is soft and doesn't make noise when it rolls-- might be fine for a different kind of dog.
died after a year,"Decent coffee maker. Thermos kept coffee warm. The big issue, however, is that the maker just died after about 1 year. If you are a regular/daily coffee drinker & cannot go without your coffee, I do not recommend this item. Kitchen appliance, in excess of $100, should last for more than a year. Planned obsolescence has devolved into pathetic obscenity."
You can't really use Cliff's Notes for being competent,"this is basically cramming. it's obvious when you know the answer to some common 'brain teaser' in an interview, and yeah, you get bonus points for doing your homework, but i'm just going to ask you harder questions until it's obvious that you're having to think about solving problems you haven't solved before.probably worthwhile if you're totally green and have never interviewed before, but if you've been through a few interviews you know what it's like, or if you've been on the other side and interviewed a lot of candidates, this book has very little to offer."
Excellent Design But Very Fragile and Cheaply Made,"I ordered these because I started going to the gym and I needed headphones that were both comfortable and stylish and these seemed to accommodate my needs.The first headphones I received did not work properly as only one earphone worked. No biggie. I went back to the store and got them replaced with working ones. I was told by the owner to be very gentle with them, which left me baffled -- Gentle? With headphones that are meant for sports? Maybe these aren't the right headphones for me after all.Anyway, I went back home with my new headphones and I was happy...for a weekI've noticed several problems shortly after; The wires popped out from the headphones and I was unable to put them back in and whenever the jack slightly moved the sound would get distorted.Do not buy these headphones if you're looking for durability. They are cheaply made.I recommend buying the Philips SHQ4000. They are similar in style and more durable."
Great little devotional,"I ordered this when my daughter was 4 and wanted something that could focus our mind toward God first thing in the morning. I was surprised to find there to be quite a lack of material out there for this age level (most seemed to be either a baby picture book or something more in-depth). This proved to be just the right combo. Not too short, not too long...just right! The illustrations are beautiful (done by the illustrator of Care Bears, I believe) and often capture my daughter's attention. Love that they include a verse and a little prayer. Super!"
No movement,It rings but does not move. I have sent 3 emails to Nanda Home and they have not responded.I am regretting buying this product.
No noticable difference,"I've had these around three months. Took them daily for about two weeks and didn't change my eating habits or exercise routine. I saw no noticeable difference and did not lose any weight nor did I feel I had more energy. I've recently started taking them daily for almost three weeks. I've lost 15lbs BUT I also significantly changed by eating habits and have been working out (sweating) daily so I would guess the results could have been obtained the old-fashioned way (diet and exercise), without the pills. I won't be refilling.On the positive side, they did ship quickly and the pills didn't do any harm but I am disappointed that the reviews from the Dr. Oz were so high when the actual results (at least for me) were pretty non-existent."
oh no ... not again.,"Much as I love Star Trek, I really wish that the actors involved wouldn't fall prey to believing they can sing! Guess those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it (Remember when Shatner & Nimoy tried to sing? At least ONE of them is trying to bury the memory!) Tim Russ sounds like a graduate of the Steve Urkle School of Music. And, where I wouldn't roll up my car window if he was singing along with the radio in the car next to me (unlike the aforementioned gentlemen) -- I certainly wound NOT invest in a CD from Mr. Russ.It just wouldn't be logical."
The Print Cartriges Don't Fit The PictureMate Snap,"I purchased this paper and ink package at the same time I purchased an Epson PictureMate Snap 4x6 Photo Printer from Amazon. The ink cartridges didn't fit the Snap printer, and I returned the package to Amazon. I had a hard time finding cartridges for the Snap printer, so it may be fairly new and the cartridges hard to find in the after market. That being said, I am sure the paper and ink will be just fine if you have the printer they are designed for."
Slickrock,"I have read all of Laura Crum books and I love all of them, this lady is an excellent writer, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals especially horses."
For Orchid Historians Only,"One of the members of my book club chose this book mainly because she loves true stories. We were all sorely disappointed in this book. We found it to be slow and boring and was a chore to get through. The only people who could enjoy this book would be orchid historians or the orchid ""philes"" described in the book."
The Genius of Brando deserves Better,while this Book has some good intentions it doesn't reach the true Depth of the Genius that Marlon Brando was.the Book never fully reaches where it attempts to go.
Would rate lower if possible...,"This cheap piece of junk tore in about the first 45 seconds of using it. I was literally just putting it over my grill after opening the package when it tore. It's that bad. Total waste of money! Do not buy this, you will be sorry!"
No-Budget Cinema,"The theatrical trailer proclaims that this 1961 schlock-fest was ""filmed ENTIRELY on location in Yucca Flats!"" How's that for an endorsement? Actually, the trailer is far superior to this dreary attempt at Z-grade science-fiction, with no synchronized dialogue but more voiceover narration than any movie in history. ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" does not belong in the ""so bad it's funny"" category - it's just plain bad. Recommended only to fans of Tor Johnson."
Informative but extremely biased in tone,"This book gives you the basic overview of Sikh history. Unfortunately, at times the author seems more concerned with his opinion that no reasonable person could believe in any of this than he is with actually recording the facts. It's becoming a little too cliche to talk about a religion and to label its followers as blind to the realities of the world. This books seems more concerned with discounting Sikhism than exploring its dogma."
Just usual stuff,"All songs sounds like the same (there is only one slowly song on it), like just good stuff of the 80`s, with no new elements (I already heard that style hundred times). The sound is great, but that is all"
Remember the movie Toy Story?,"Remember the movie Toy Story, when Mr Potatohead was cruising the aisles with Tour Guide Barbie in the Fisher-Price Power Wheels Corvette? This horn will make any car into the Fisher-Price Barbie Car. Yes it was easy to install and yes, it does work, but if your a guy, any car you drive will instantly become Pink and made of plastic, not to mention, you will never have sex again."
Crazy/Creepy,"Just trust me! I won't casually open the door to anyone at 4 A.M.! This movie was not too bad but it lacked some common sense when it comes to protecting oneself! The setting is eerie/creepy. The acting lacks a bit! I didn't really care for the way it ended!In terms of picture quality and sound, both were excellent!"
A great title at a great price,"This game is a masterpiece, whether you are into adventure, espionage, or action, also this will show you a true cinematic experience.This game has everything you need to keep you entertained, if you have been following the series the you are not even reading this, but if you haven't this game is some serious fun for everyone, even those not familiar.The only downside is that this game focuses on stealth and some people might not be to patient to move on the exact moment, or wait for a soldier to get distracted, but if you try it you might surprise your self on how addictive the game is.And now with a true bargain price, Greatly recommended. Don't miss it."
Still Not Finished... Groan!,"Now maybe this book isn't geared for light bedtime readers who can only get through 10 pages a night, because I am barely half way through after many nights of reading. I get the gist of this book, the writing style is enjoyable, the characters quirky and eerily calm for murderers. I agree with the criticism that the timeframe for this book is lost somewhere. Did it take place in the 60's, 70's or 80's? There are hippies and at one point the characters are watching ""Petticoat Junction"". Is that on eternal cable or regular TV? I am enjoying plugging away at this book, but maybe I'd be much happier reading something else. This is a used paperback, so the only investment is my time. I tried reading Tartt's ""The Little Friend"" and couldn't make it through and neither could several friends of mine. Maybe Ms. Tartt would be best served by taking a course in brevity...."
Shaver Review,"I am very pleased with this shaver. It provides a very close and comfortable shave with minimum effort. Much better than previous Microscreen from Remington. Was able to get five days without recharging with no problem. It is well balanced and easy and comfortable to hold. Two small areas could be improved: (1) improvement could be in the off/on button which requires two hands to operate; and (2) during cleaning, the cutter blade will sometimes come off - but is easy to reassemble. Yes - I would definitely buy it again."
WARNING - POOR QUALITY,"This edition claims 24 bit remastering but on listening it's clear that many if not all tracks have been recorded off an LP. You can hear the clicks and pops of an old vinyl pressing.Apparently a new version is now available from another label. I don't know about the source for that recording, but this is very poor considering its high price. Unfortunately the return date had elapsed before I listened to it, otherwise I would have returned to Amazon.In summary, the music is 5 stars but the recording is 1 star. No point in 24 bit remastering for a copy made from an old LP!"
Pretty Good,"This is classic G-Unit material.Only true fans would like this stuff.Get Rich Or Die Tryin and Beg For Mercy are better,of course.But then again,they had much better production.Only one song is bad:Fat B!tch.Other than that,all the songs (excluding the skits)are good,great,or ok.All the songs are not on original beats,but by beats from other artists,such as Eminem & P.

Fixed a Partition Problem,"For some unknown reason, my Acer Laptop came with the hard drive partitioned into two drives of 25 gigs each. C drive maxed out at 25gig while D drive was empty. Partition Magic made it easy to move the partition and free up the C drive.partition magic does a lot more, but I haven't needed the rest."
Snap N Store Storage Boxes,Great value--probably not for someone that wants something decorative--these are just for storage. Stack nicely!! Arrived promptly as always!!! Thanks
Beautiful soft doll,"I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old. It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle. I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play. This doll is also washable, a big plus. The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly. A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years."
"Out of Sight: A Slightly Different Style, But Very Well Done","Out of Sight is a new style for Leonard, it has a more romantic/sarcastic look at how things work, I enjoyed as much as any other Leonard and liked the slight change."
good tool,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great tool to have if you have kids. I have a toddler who loves fresh fruit and now I can prepare cherries for him quickly and easily, with much less mess. Will be great for making desserts with fresh cherries now, too."
not accurate,"This movie is a terrible way to ""honor"" such a great book. In the movie you do not see the symbolism, and it is not true to the text at all. In the movie Dimmsdale doesn't die as he is supposed to in the novel. How could someone take such a good movie and make it into Demi Moore trash???? If you want to know about the scarlet letter i am sure has a great copy of the BOOK for sale. Trust me it is 100% better."
Correct book; wrong format,"The book is the right one I needed for class. There is, however, an issue with the book's description on the website - it is listed as hardcover, when in fact it is paperback."
Very nice dinosaur toy set with one minor drawback,"My son loves dinosaurs and he was thrilled to receive this set as a gift. The dinosaurs are good size and with good details. There is no funny plastic or paint odors. The bucket is great for keeping all the pieces organized.The only thing that makes this less than a 5 star product is the play mat. The picture on amazon makes the mat looks bigger than it really is. It actually measures about 2 ft x 2 ft. It's made out of very thin plastic....similar to that of a grocery bag. Because it is so thin, it curls up and would not lay flat. After 30 minutes of gentle playing, the mat start getting tears. Otherwise, this is a great dinosaur set."
Excellent tactical overview of nymphing techniques,"A very easy to read discussion of tactics and tips. Very enjoyable read as well. If only I could get my friends Bill and Dave to read it, they might catch fish."
I'm very Confused...,"I thought this book wasn't bad, but I felt like I was being rushed at the end, like K.E.W. ran out of ideas and had to end the book quickly. It left me thoroughly confused. If anyone GETS this book and wants to enlighten me, let me know. E-mail me at sweets_234@hotmail.com. Yes, I was serious, very serious. I don't understand it all. Grrr. Other than that little detail, I really enjoyed everything execpt the end. The writing, as usual, was surperb, and the love scenes were great. The thing about Ashton is that he is the only male K.E.W. character in all of the books I have read that doesn't force the female character into doing something she doesn't want to. In fact, he tells her that a simple ""no"" will do. Hee Hee. I still dunno if he is my favorite. Ruark from ""Shanna"" was pretty cool. :) Anywho, all in all, it wasn't such a bad book. But, compared to ""Shanna"" and ""A Rose in Winter"" it didn't stand a chance.~Olivia~"
poor band quality,"I purchased this watch about a year and a half ago and have been through THREE wristbands thus far. For the cost of replacement wristbands, I could have bought a new watch. It's a shame to have to buy a new watch because the wristband can't hold up to normal wear"
"Great playing, but Nimbus' echo-chamber sound distracts","There are some real gems on this album that are classic Copland in quality, but are probably unfamiliar to many. Alan Marks is a sensitive interpreter of these works. He is percussive when he should be, or rollicking, or tender and evocative. Listen to the 10 seconds of the Old American Songs, Long Time Ago. I cannot imagine it played more expressively. The Rodeo selections are pleasing -- I always like to hear another version of something that is well known.My only problem with this album is the way Nimbus recorded the piano. Nimbus claims it is a natural sound. I have quite a few Nimbus recordings -- they are adventuresome in their selections -- but I prefer hearing less echo and more of the subtle interplay of the notes coming right from the piano. I think the echo distracts from the sound, but that is just my opinion."
"""An Economy of Words, A Wealth of Information""","Imagine how much easier life would be if you're struggling with a corporate intranet, e-process mapping, corporate learning, tools, knowledge leadership, middle management, communications shortfalls, web initiatives, collaboration strategies and overall knowledge management issues, if you could have Tom Koulopoulos and Carl Frappaolo by your side. If you need ""smart"" answers to tough questions regarding your company's approach to KM, Tom's passion and Carl's keen observational skills are a potent combination. Pick up Smart Things To Know About Knowledge Management; it's a tiny investment of your time and attention to benefit from their years of expertise and involvement with over 400 corporate KM projects."
"Interesting, but not really well enough written.","John Barrow's most recent book has a lot of interesting ideas, but it is pretty hard to read -- even for people well versed in the area. If it were better written or edited, the hard concepts he puts across would make it through to the reader. But there are a lot of interesting ideas, and if you can make it through to the end, the last chapter ties things together fairly well. One would best read the chapter summaries and the final chapter, then read the rest for the details."
Did nothing for my joint pain.,I was recommend this for my ankle joint pain. I used whole bottle and saw no noticeable effect.
One of my favorite TV shows of all time,Gilligan is amazingly witty with the one liners that are more thought out than some give him credit for. Being free to watch made the Amazon Prime membership more valuable to me then the free shipping. Having watched Gilligan when it was on Saturday night at 8PM as a kid takes me back to a less hectic time in my mind.
"Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing","""Noble House,"" James Clavell's epic story of Hong Kong, is long (over 1,300 pages), and it has a rich plot with a rich cast of characters. Over the course of one week, a lot seems to happen, but nothing really happens because not that much changes. There's some deaths and some sex, but really this book is occupied mainly by swearing and intrigue.If Clavell's understanding of Hong Kong is correct (and we have no reason to suspect that it is not), then Hong Kong is run by a bunch of incestuous pirates. Its wealth and power derive from it being mainland China's strategic entrepot to the world, which is also what accounts for its instability and intrigue.It's a great book for those who have some understanding and some contact with Hong Kong. Otherwise, it really is nothing more than sound and fury."
Samsung printer,good quality print for cost. only complaints is that the paper tray isn't deep enough to hold more than 50 sheets of paper. It occasionally jams and the paper feed doesn't have a release for the paper jam so you have to fight to pull it out. I am fairly satisfied otherwise as I only use it for school to print up notes and papers.
save your money,"Not worth the money, tried this product on an old car of mine that has water stained windows without any luck. I folowed the directions and tried the product several times without results."
"Not a curse, but Singapore Sling's blessing","It can only be speculated what chemicals these guys were on when Singapore Sling recorded this CD, but chances are it was probably the same stuff The Verve took during 'A Storm In Heaven' or Primal Scream popped during 'Screamadelica'. 'Curse Of Singapore Sling' is a whirlwind hallucinatory guitar ride, a vitriolic and mind-altering experience. Just think Jesus And Mary Chain meets Spacemen 3 or a more psychadelic The Raveonettes, all with a touch of fierce psychobilly swagger. Amongst other interesting substances, you can also smell the dust and gas-fumes trailing behind the Harley. You can smell the danger. 'Curse Of Singapore Sling' is great album by another overlooked Swedish band."
Another Home Run in Dog Toys !!,I bought this for my best friend since she has a couple of yellow labs and she was looking for an easier way to throw a ball for them to chase. The fact that you do not have to touch the slimy ball once they bring it back is a MAJOR bonus !! I bought her both the regular size and the Jr. Breeze now lets my best friend know when it is time to play with the Chuck It. What a great idea / toy!!
Was perfect for the girls!,Arrived on time. Girls love. Wish had more scratch sheets. Would recommend for clean and simple fun. Four year old gift.
Sharp but rusty,I bought these knives for my new house and have had them for a month or so and half of them are already rusted after just a couple uses. They are pretty sharp and cut great but I dont get it how can they rust so quickly. I wouldnt recommend them because I am sure you can find better knives that dont rust this quickly and this easily.
Vtech is greedy for money,"This phone used to come with rechargable ""AAA"" batteries that are cheap to replace. Now it comes with a proprietary Vtech ""battery pack"" that is much more costly. Lame! I will not buy more Vtech products."
Newtonian Demonstrator,Great birthday present for our 13 yr. old son. Product is sturdy and well made. Quick ship by SELLER.
"Accidental Buy, but worth every penny","I bought this kit for working with computers, only to find out that it didn't have the correct size for any of the bits. With this being said, the tool kit is quite beneficial for everything else (that is larger scale). I have used the tool kit for repairs at home (doors), at pools (fixing our pump) and various different environments and it passes with flying color."
terrible,"I purchased this music and did not know that I had to have the ""Cloud"" to actually receive it. I had no choice and tried to cancel my order because I refuse to buy the ""Cloud"" and still got charged for the music and I still have no access to it.I WILL NOT buy any more music from here!"
disappointing,I found this CD to be a disappointment. I enjoy Bernadette Peter's work but this album was not up to the usual standard I have come to expect.The production on the album was poor and the quality of the songs was mediocre at best. The pace and phrasing of the album seemed off to me. The songs were all slow and lacking in emotion.Ms Peter's voice was excellent as always. However the passion or feeling behind the songs seemed to be lacking.Overall I would say the album is not up to Ms Peter's usual quality.
Falls Apart Quickly; Used Cardboard Inside,"This is really a poor quality wallet, and I can't believe how many good reviews this item has gotten. Out of the box, the wallet looked nice. Three weeks later, the edges have worn away, exposing the fabric underneath, and the leather is peeling back from the cardboard inside. The leather looks and feels genuine, but it's truly the thinnest leather I have ever seen - as thin as a piece of paper. The inside of the wallet is re-used cardboard, and it looks like it was cut from an Indian cereal box - it still has the lettering and graphics from the box.From other reviews, I thought this was going to be a good product for the price. But I would have been much better off paying more for a better wallet."
"A good game, but a joke if you were expecting a sequel.","I rushed out like others who had played the first Champions game to get this one...only to be disappointed in the extreme. Re-used graphics, re-used npc characters, re-used music, and re-used glitches from the first game!!!This game feels like outtakes from the last one and could have easily been released last year as ""Champions of Norath : Realms of Everquest Uncut"". If Sony was going to hold on to it that long I would have hoped that they could have at -least- improved it or even fixed the glitches. All I see is a -slightly- revamped game with a -few- new things (including new glitches!) and an even weaker story line!!All that being said, the game is still fun for online play, but after playing the first one this game lacks any freshness whatsoever in the single player story.Come on Sony! Stop picking our pockets!!"
Mostly great product,"The dock is a great idea and it does what it what is suppose to; however, in my situation I need a longer cord from the dock to the laptop and I can't seem to find one. The product ends up being less useful to me because of that. At the very least there should be an accessory that can be purchased that will extend the cable's length. If you don't have that problem you will probably like this product a lot."
Tasteless,"I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews. This was the most bland chowder I've ever had. I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing! Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing. Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender. The consistency was pretty good too. It just had no flavor. Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too."
Does not fit,Does not fit the two gallon bucket. Will not create a sealed container with the bucket with the chicken nips.
no bathrooms!,I don't know why this book indicates that bathrooms are included inside? There are like two pictures of bathrooms and they are both at poor angles. Do people not use the loo in small spaces? i guess i'll go bathe in the ocean!
A Good Start,"This is helpful and informative, but is not a scholarly work. there are other more scholarly books available. i recommend this for bible study students, but not for theology students. more indepth books are available."
Melted in my toolboxes,This tool melted in my tool boxes. I don't understand contractor tools that are not designed to be stored in hot-in-the-sun tool boxes. I never got to use it.
GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL.,"I have always liked Henry Winkler. His portrayal of the ""Fonz"" in ""Happy Days"" has made him a favorite with me.He does a great job in this movie also. A great movie to watch around Christmas every year."
"same game, better graphics","Pros:- the original game concept still works- cool and very detailed graphics- improved micromanagement (challenging!)- cool new terrain-tools (really amazing graphics and effects)- new region play allows metropolitan areas- nice user-interface- roads are placed automaticallyCons:- despite graphics, nothing has changed much- much smaller city-maps- region play doesn't work properly (it is not like having one huge city)- I cannot choose architectural styles or landscapes (Palm trees in NYC???)- building highways is still a PITB.- houses and roads still stick to the square/block-system- Incredible hardware requirements- game crashes often- no scenarios!!!- roads are placed automatically (good thing, bad thing)Summary: a good game based on old qualities that impresses through its gorgeous graphics at first. However, it also leaves a somewhat bitter after-taste. Even though it is worth its bucks, more could/should have been possible...I don't think EA is good for Maxis."
A good companion to typical text-book approaches.,"For people who need to get things done quickly using JavaScript, this book can be extremely helpful. It is best used as a reference text in conjunction with other lower-level handbooks. Unless you have some programming experience, I would not recommend this book as a tutorial or introduction to JavaScript, but it is a valuable source of many effective techniques that can shorten your development time."
Best Golf Sandals I've ever had,"I love golf sandals and have had 5 or 6 different styles. These are by far the most comfortable and best looking on the foot that I have ever tried. Easy to adjust to the foot, and I have a wide foot. Wore them all day with no problems, even going to the store after golf."
waste of money,"this phone has been the worst purchase I have made in a long time. you can only link one base unit with mulitply handhelds, (ie: no intercom capability between them). it won't store the new time with the early day lights savings time. you have to be RIGHT ON TOP of the screen to see the display, the wall bracket does not double at a tilt to make the display easier to read from your desk. motorola is USELESS."
An Excellent Werewolf Resource,"This book is extremely helpful, especially to new players of Werewolf: The Apocalypse. It adds a lot to the game, including a variety of new merits and flaws, extra rites and gifts, and detailed information about the changing breeds other than the garou. A must-have for any player."
Worse sequel ever,"I loved Against The Fall Of Night since the first time I picked it up in a second hand book store. If I have nothing else to read, I can still pick it up and open to any random page and enjoy myself. So when Beyond The Fall Of Night came out, I was so excited. Major let down. How Clarke could have approved this is beyond me, no pun intended. Against was charming, putting you in the mind of a little boy who grows up as the only child to be born in seven thousand years. This book introduces you to strange characters who you have no interest in. I stuck with it, in the hopes that the Mad Mind would win and do away with these awful characters. At least they didn't carry this waste of paper into a third book."
"Adequate, but...","The only other short introduction to the Reformation that I've read is the one by G.R. Elton, and this one is not as good. Chadwick treats his subject casually and judges movements or people without making us privy to the reasons why he does so. There are also inexplicable biases in what is treated: for example, he gives us quite a few pages (a chapter?) on the religious life of England under Cromwell (1640s and 50s), but barely spends more than a sentence or two on the religious wars in France (1562-98).On the whole, the tone wasn't my thing either. On the few occasions he referred to women (remember them?) it was in an casual and sometimes apparently joking way. Not quite sexist, but it makes you wonder.Skip it. There are hundreds of histories of the Reformation. Most will be better than this."
Must-have!,"I cannot say enough about this recording, so in order to not write on and on I will be as breif as possible. The cast is excellent!!! Just amazing! It is great to see the torch being passed from Varnay to Nillson! Act Two is a non-stop tour-de-force. Anyone who refers to Lohengrin as ""Slow-and-grim,"" will be eating crow after listening to this performance. Varnay is THE Ortrud in my opinion, only challanged by Leonie Rysanek in the latter half of her career. Varnay's gargantuan voice personifies the blood-thirsty presence of Orturd, and the curse is simply amazing."
One died after 3k miles.,"I replaced this along the strut mounts for my front 2005 mitsubishi lancer ES. after 3k miles the left side started to rattle when going on irregular road and started making weird noises when cornering. Had to replace the bearing for a OE one been fine since then. I dont know what happened but i dont recommended it. Also it was a bigger than the regular OE one although in the kyb catalog says it fits dunno if it has anything to do with it, right one is fine so far..."
"I loved King Tim III personality jock, classic, pure rap","I would give myself five stars but that would be a bit pretentious on my behalf. However I truly feel that I helped establish an art that not many thought would go beyond the fly sounds of Kurtis Blow, and hip hop sounds of RunDMC. I truly feel blessed to be part of such great history in the making. For those who need to contact me please do so at 212-234-1266. I am open to discussion on that era an what it meant to me. I am in the process of getting a E-mail in the meantime please use my brothers cmrichao.@pibly.orgsincerely,King Tim III personality jock"
Great book!,"If you have ever had any family who was a submariner, this is a MUST read. The detail and the information is great and the stories shed as much light as they do questions. I know I will be going back and talking to my father, who served on the USS Jack (605), to hear what he has to say."
Buy a different book.,"This book, despite its acceptable editing and writing standards, just does not contain a large amount of material needed to pass the exam. Either buy one of the 1300-pagers or Exam Cram, or both. This book is the worst of both worlds unfortunately."
Stage play?,"The music and songs are beautifully done. Costumes are wonderful. However, it is not celtic music. It is set up like a stage play. I was very disappointed in the DVD. I have watched it one time, won't watch it again. I was hoping for better through the complete show but better never happened. The CD was better but only because I could not watch what was going on....These gentlemen have such wonderful talent and voices. I hate to see them go downhill in this manner. I understand the desire to do something new but this was way off the hook. I wasted my money buying it. Not sure I will buy anything else of theirs."
Remedy Lacks Great Original Ingredients,"Goldberg's first novel, Bee Season, was one of the best firsts I'd read in years. Instead of sticking with what worked beautifully the first time around, Goldberg resorted to a couple of clunky contrivances to spoil the formula in Wickett's Remedy. The novel starts out strong, with interesting characters and a compelling historical story line. Sadly, the interruptions of Goldberg's annoying margin commentary and the inscrutable QD Soda newsletter provide nothing more than a distraction. And by the end of the novel, even the story line gives out, stranded along with the protagonist, Lydia Wickett, on an island where both the good work she hopes to do and the story Goldberg begins with such promise amount to nothing much."
Good Stuff,"Great music for dancing.It has interesting slow foxrots and and faster foxtrots, whichwork well for American style dancing. There are also somereally different songs, which are good for American Rumba."
A total waste of paper,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The premise of the book seemed so promising! Gwendolyn Morris's writing was cheesy at best, horribly stilted at worst. I couldn't believe someone would pay her to write. True, short stories do not provide a lot of space to go in depth but it doesn't mean you have to write so far fetched, unrealistic, fake scenerios, with dialogue that is stupid just to fill the page. I would not recommend this book to any thinking person but if you are interested in cotton candy writing, please feel free to pick up this book. Just remember, too much candy can make you sick and possibly rot your teeth."
Simple and Great.,I'm constantly looking for something to write notes down on. I'm still a pen and pad kind of guy. I've always got some of these on me. The real love I have for these is for mind mapping and outlining. A pad of these and a cork board helps me effectively develop ideas. If you're still a tactile kind of person like myself - get 'em.
What is the deal?,"I am sorry. I am a major everclear fan,for a reason:because I liked the way they sounded. With this album, everclear shows how different they can sound. Yeah I want them to sound diverse but I don't want that to include pop. They should stick to what they are good at:rock music. I am glad I listened to the whole album a couple times over before I bought it. At first you want to like it because it is everclear, then you listen some more and realize that they turned pop. I hope that this is just some faze because I really want the old everclear back! The next album should be better.........."
Phantom of the Opera,Excellent and the music is perfect. The Play is wonderful as well. A must see for all ages. Don't miss it while on Broadway.
"Good idea, poorly executed","Well it does allow you to shave your back- but the trimmer does not give you a close shave! So you get a less hairy back, but it's still a hairy back!!"
Italian,"Italian for Dummies (With Audio CD)Great condition, the product arrived earlier than expected and in better condition than I expected. It actually matched the product description, so I'm pleased with that. I will purchase from them again."
Very small respect to a normal person's head,its not covering the ears and also at the same time just come over the upper part f the ear giving it a very weird look. I will suggestto buy it for kids only
"Good character development, poor structure","This book is ultimately disappointing due to the author's failure to maintain dramatic tension. Tartt gives away the main climax in the Preface. The reader immediately knows what will happen, and knows before long why it happens, then has to watch it slowly unfold. A later dramatic moment is unsuprising despite being (it seemed to me) incongruous with the character, and it comes largely out of the blue - nothing leads up to or follows from it.Some other reviewers' comments that I agree with: easily 200 pages overlength, feels like the 1950's, while it purports to be in the 1980's (I think), and the ease with which the students slip into their murderous behavior is simply not believable. The characters are quirky enough to be interesting, yet still believable and sympathetic, but the plot line is not credible."
Must have lost a lot in editing,"There's no story to this film. Jones and Streep are great actors, but nothing happens during the whole thing. We got the feeling that all of the important parts of the movie got deleted."
On my turntable in '79.,"Nice little band from 1977-1983. This debut was a great rocking' album in the throws of disco. Great tracks like ""Hello, Hello, Hello"", the top 40 classic ""Don't Ever Wanna Lose Ya"" #40 just great licks here, with great sounding keyboards. ""P.U.N.K."" (Puny Undernourished Kid) a song that should of been on everybody's playlist back in 1979, but wasn't. ""Shoot"" and ""The Last Show"" were also great songs. This album should of been a million seller, but the record label just didn't back them up. A great lost album of good Rock 'N Roll!"
Healing Music.,"Sandi's vocals on this album are simply ethereal! This, combined with lyrics which reflect life's transitions and the heart-warming rythmical ecoustic texture she has produced, is truly a combination that only a master can achieve. This is positively music to heal the soul."
Total Immersion swimming,The book overall is well written. The drills are very hard to understand and perform. It seems that to get a better idea of how to perform them you need to buy the DVD.Not an out of the box self help book. It will require the purchase of the DVD or hire a coach to help with the drills.I would recommemd purchasing the book but do not pay new price; pick up a used copy.
NOT compatible with all brands!,"The description says it's compatible with all laminator brands, but it's not! My brand requires a carrier, which this package does not have. Now I have to keep searching for ""just"" a carrier to laminate handouts for students, or buy another package that DOES come with a carrier. God grief!"
"""The"" classic novel of the dominance/submission genre","By far the best novel of the dominance and submission genre, or if you will, the sadomasochistic genre, The Story of O captures its reader in the bonds of its dark world of sexual slavery. As O is drawn further into the enticing confines of total submission to the men that use her, we the readers find ourselves unable to put the book down, as we are horrified and delighted simultaneously. Although not for the fainthearted, anyone with a strong erotic imagination will certainly enjoy this classic work of fiction"
Don't Buy.,I gave this two stars instead of one because it was sturdy and came with a glass shade. It is painted not plated. Not metalic. The paint was very very poor quality. Spots were missing paint. There was a scratch. Paint had rubbed off on the packing materials. Looks like a $10 used lamp rather than $100 new. Came packed in crumbly styro so ended up with mess in Living room and no practical way to return it.
Has a minimum wattage requirement,"Along with the 500 watt maximum draw this product has a minimum draw as well. I used this in conjunction with a relay to power something with more than 500 watts, the relay coil was about 8 watts. When hooked up this way neither switch does anything and the output is 88 volts, who designed this garbage? While playing with it I noticed the output is not 120volts like the input, it varied from 100-110 volts.I don't know what the minimum wattage is, but here's a scary example, lets say you are replacing a light fixture, you turn the switch off, now you unscrew the bulbs. As soon as you take the last bulb out the power is turned back on without your knowledge. Use the small off switch under the plate if your replacing anything, better yet turn off the power. Better yet don't buy this piece of crap!"
Mom is not good with business.,I would try to get a cleaning job. The mother is nonstop going for get rich schemes not justified by her dire straits; she's just plunging deeper and deeper into failure.

Cute face but no talent,"She has the looks and perhaps some of the moves, but how the heck did she get into singing when there are enough telenovelas to go by? A generic voice without body and character attempts some formulaic lackluster songs that, at least, are designed to have commercial mass appeal. Ho-hum. Just remember to listen to the greats and you'll know what I mean by ""mediocre""."
Terrible,"The idea is not a bad one: a New Jersey boy decides not to go to law school after college and instead heads to New York to fulfill his dream of being an actor. In the process, he disappoints his working-class father, loses his beloved girlfriend, and meets humiliation and failure.The execution, unfortunately, is awful. Except for a very young Kelly Ripa, who plays the role of the girlfriend quite charmingly, the actors are just awful. You'd think Robbie Bryan would be believable in the part of the struggling actor, since he wrote the movie, which is based on his own life story, but I'm afraid Mr. Bryan has absolutely no talent whatsoever. The rest of the cast is not much better and the directing manages to be clichéd and slightly ridiculous.Unless you want to be an actor, and need to be reminded that the path is hard and the odds of success are minimal, there's no reason to see this movie."
Unlike anything that I have ever heard before,"Dropkick Murphys play an amazing combination of loud hard angry music with bagpipes thrown in for good measure. :)I realize that I am most likely much older than their normal fan base. So that goes to show you that they can appeal to all ages. You don't have to be a kid to like this band. You just have to have a rebellious streak, like I do, at times. It definitely comes out when I watch or listen to this band. They are loud and fun.The St. Patrick's day concert alone is worth the purchase of this dvd. Buy this dvd. You may be pleasantly surprised, like I was the first time that I heard this band. :)"
These pads are nothing special,"I found these pads to be like many others: Bulky & uncomfortable...They shifted & bunched in my panties while I slept. When I woke up the pad had shifted a lot to the back of my underwear, & because of this, I had leaks...I won't buy these again."
Fun and Easy,"I might not feel like I am getting much of a workout, I don't get out of breath or very sweaty, but it is fun and easy to use and gets me off the couch. :-)"
"stilted, lifeless biography","A formal and very correct study, this biography has little new info about anything. An all-around poorly done job."
worth it.,"I loved it. It worked and still works. I think the instructor it great. As for all those people who didn't like it I think it was a little to much of a beginners tape for them. This was my first introduction to anything even resembling Pilates or Yoga and that style exercise and I can't make it to a gym so it was nice to have all those icons reminding me and teaching me and everything was useful knowledge. The people who found it painfully easy should be being perhaps intermediate DVDs instead, this is a definite beginners tape and works very well."
hooray!!! for the American prophecies book.,"I totally agree with the thinking behind this book written by Mr.Evans...A servant cannot serve two masters,God and Satan;Nor can a servant of God be against Israel, for they are his chosen people,and the apple of his eye, and Satan's plan is destroy them; as he has tried to in the past.This book written by Mr. Evans is a must read for the christians of the world,it puts the plight of the Jews in it's proper perspective...... this one get's an ""A""Michael K. Bentley"
Suck,Ok what the hell 25.00 for a vhs tape of v/h/s now that worthless hell i can make my own copy on vhs if wanted
A better idea,"Here is a new idea on on old product, I own other reciprocating saws and they only do one thing. The movable handle make plunge cuts easy and the adjustable foot gives better control at angles. Just a better idea."
A great way to learn about different flavors,"This is a great way of learning about different cheeses, and what there flavors are.Gorgonzola is a stronger cheese, usually used for salads - very tangy with a stronger after taste, something I think everyone can really enjoy in that matter. A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar. I recommend this sampler highly."
LOVE THIS PACK!!!!,"THIS IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PACK THAT I OWN AND MY ALL TIME FAVORITE. I TAKE IT WITH ME EVERY CHANCE I GET. TOTALLY WATERTIGHT AND RUGGED LIGHT WEIGHT MATERIAL. WHEN ITS ALL PACKED AND READY TO GO, TRAP SOME AIR IN IT BEFORE SEALING THE TOP. THIS MAKES FOR A COMFORTABLE BACKPACK THAT CONTOURS TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR BODY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
Le Choriste or The Chorus,"Loved this movie! Highly recommend. However, hope you don't mind sub titles! The film is French and good family film."
Not a fan....,"I've read so many great reviews about this book that I couldn't wait to dive into it...but after the first 100 pages, the story line failed to engage me,"
excellant,the seasons are really well depicted you can almost feel very warn during the summer section and chilly during the winter with the icicles tinkling all around
romeo sukz,itz hard to think dat romeo is master p's son... And romeo sayz hez rich when itz actually his precious daddy who gives his money to romeo!!! Romeo is stupider then he looks!... if thatz even possible...
My 3 year old granddaughter loves it,My 3 year old granddaughter loves it and it was well worth the money that I spent on this toy.
"Satisfactory burner, horrible software","Decent hardware I suppose, but do look elsewhere for burning software - Sony CD Extreme is a very flawed CD creation program with minimal features and sometimes burns music at the wrong speed and corrupts data files, not to mention it's stability and compatibility issues.If you can get the CD burner at a decent price, go for it, but look into Nero, CDex or Easy CD Creator for putting together your CD-Rs."
How do you get $6.49 ($2.70 / oz) on a .63 product?,"I like this product very much, but the way it is advertised is very misleading.Unless you include the weight of the jar, the price per once is $10.30!"
Not bad for the money,"Not the quality that I would have expected from Case Logic. Inner sleeves are kind of flimsy, but functional.But then again, not bad for the money. If you want something simple that's not too expensive this will do the trick."
Not quite right,"I've been reading SK's books for 20 years now and was almost always impressed by his way with words. Somewhere along the way I did encounter a couple of books which I found disappointing, but with King's productivity level it's a very small ratio. Sadly this is one of those books.While it's definitely King's writing style, it is overloaded with invented words, which make the reading difficult and instead of adding to the plot they seem to only take from it. The plot itself is quite interesting, but the deliverance is tiresome as the story keeps jumping between different time-lines and events, some of which seem to be pointless to the story.I wouldn't call Lisey's story a bad book, but it's not a masterpiece for sure. Quite average for SK and thus - disappointing."
This really is Bond and beyond&#65533;,"007 finally comes face to face with Le Gérant, the blind criminal genius who heads The Union crime syndicate. The meeting does not disappoint. Raymond Benson's writing is stylish and assured. It seems that he has deliberately attempted to push back the boundaries of the conventional Bond novel - the sex scenes are more explicit than any of their predecessors, the torture scenes more graphic. In-jokes sit comfortably alongside brutal violence. Benson's Bond is ruthless and resourceful, which is just the way we like him. Nothing is sacrosanct, and there are plenty of thrills and a few surprises before the end. Highly recommended, but let me give you a word of warning - if you like rats then there is one scene that will probably upset you!"
I loved this album even though I am a not a Ace of Base fan (4 Stars),"I was in college around 1995, gosh it was way back, I never really listened to Ace of Base, I did like the song ""The Sign"", ""Wheel of Fortune"" they were big hits in South Africa. I was always into music so my friend gave me a recorded cassette of this album. mmmmm Ace of Base I thought, I put it on, used it as my cleaning the room cassette. The songs grew onto me, especially the non - hits, it was deeper than I expected, more professional, ""Angel Eyes"", ""Ravine"" beautiful ballads, ""Strange Ways"", ""Never gonna say I'm Sorry"", ""Whispers in Blindness"" all great tracks. I wore the tape out, had to eventually buy the CD. Although I do not have any other Ace of Base CD, I actually loved this CD. It really is a mature sound for Ace of Base even if it is not their best commercial success. I give it 4 Stars."
A truly moving book,"I have seen several erudite reviews of Roy's book. My own response to the book is not intellectual but emotional. After years, I have read a book which has moved me to tears and haunted me for days after the reading. The powerful and evocative imagery, the poignancy of the story, the depressingly real characterisation, the fluid shifts across time periods ... I guess these are some of the specifics which make Roy's book so distinctive. But dissecting the parts is doing injustice to the whole. In the ultimate analysis, this is a book which will evoke a ""gut-reaction"" from most readers and impact in some way their perception of life. And that is the real test of a good book."
best dog shampoo,This shampoo smells great and gets rid of the dog smell. The scent lasts for a long time too! Best dog shampoo that I have found. Wont use anything else.
Captivating -- I couldn't put it down.,"As an avid student of Asian history and culture, I've read many accounts of the Japanese occupation of Korea. This is the best so far.As I have lived in Korea for 10+ years, I have Korean friends in the same age group as the author, Richard Kim. From the first-hand accounts I have heard from my friends, I believe Lost Names accurately describes conditions for the common Korean citizen during the Occupation period.Through the entire book, I believed I was reading the author's autobiography. I didn't realize that was not the case until I read the Author's Note on the last page. I kept wondering why, since these were his memoirs, the author didn't write in the past tense.For me personally, the book would have been easier to read if it had been written in the past tense. In any case, I highly recommend this book for those who love to learn about the tragic history of the beautiful Land of the Morning Calm."
Note different editions,"The photo of the book cover amazon now shows (of Franco as Andrea Chenier) apparently is of the new second edition of the English language version of Boagno's book which I've read was re-written and expanded after Corelli's death a couple of years ago. But, all of the descriptive information in this amazon listing is still for the original earlier English language version that the reviews seem to be about. If you buy this book, be sure you know what you are getting. I'm not advocating for or against either version. Just pointing out a potential for confusion. And, if anyone reads the new edition and reviews it, please make clear in your review which edition you describe. Thanks!"
One of the worst movies ever!,"I can't believe Candice Bergen was in this movie...hello!!!! The acting was terrible, the plot was so..whatever. I believe we've been there and done this before. According to the synopsis, it should have been like a newer version of Misery. But it was NOT! Terrible acting by everyone. Please, leave this one on the shelf."
5mhp shoes,"Primarily, I like the message that's written inside the box. Months ago I wanted to buy these pair of shoes cause they look very simple and comfortable. Well, the results were awesome,people started asking me where did I get the shoes? For a driving shoes, the are very innovating, even though I haven't driven with them yet...They just fit with dark, classic or white jeans, chinos (even rolling up the pants to give them protagonist)I can recommend this brand to anyone whose buying luxury and style. The leather's spanish, which means quality and comfort!!"
Load of tripe,"Absolute absurdity. I read this book back in 1989 and followed the ""news headlines"" to compare them to actual headlines. Not even close. The air and water are cleaner and technology is making lives better."
Nice Solo Effort....but,"I completely agree with the last couple of reviewers, however after some time listening to the CD, it hasnt exactly made it to the top pile of current favorites. The songs are very well sung, and there is no doubting Angie's abilities, however many of the songs DO seems to run on, and the instrumentation/beats can be a little lackluster at times. Considering Angie's voice and her powerful lyrics, the music seems to yearn to match her power. Her latest effort however, looks to have corrected this problem, as is evidenced by the first release. Check out Angie's sophmore album, you wont be dissapointed!"
Horrible,I Don't Like this game. It was twelve dollars and i had to trade it for another game. DONT GET THE GAME! It is confusing and hard to play.
Not worth it,"This TV worked great until about 2-3 months ago. Then it started just randomly turning off after a few seconds of being on. Then it started emitting a high-pitched shriek after a few seconds of being on. This would alternate between the sound just cutting off. I'd had this tv for about 1.5 years when it started acting up. It was a nice tv when it worked, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But seriously, a tv should last longer than 1.5 years, especially for this price. I'm waiting until the after Thanksgiving sales to buy another one, so until then I have to just deal with turning my tv on and off for about 10 minutes until the sound works, the shrieking noise goes away, and it stays on on its own. I came on here to see if this was just a weird problem of my own, but I've read several reviews of this happening to other people, even sooner than it happened to me. I would definitely not recommend this to anybody."
Doesn't work for roaches,"It doesn't work! Roaches are roaming around as they were before, even sitting on the device! It was a waste of my money. Can't bother to pack and send it back for a refund."
"Okay, but too dark","It was a very stimulating story, excieting and interesting, but it is much darker then Redwall, with more magic. One of the ""baddies"" practices some sort of black magic. I would have liked to read the rest of the series, but I thought that plot element was unnecessary. Too bad."
Fun for a week but not all summer!!!,"The slide does work but it needs a lot of supervision. Its tricky to climb the slide but its fun once up there. You need to be careful that it does not drift to the pool edge as its easy to topple over. Our slide did spring a leak after a few days but it was easily fixed. If you want a bit of fun for a short time this is a good buy, if you want to enjoy it for any longer don't bother. the age range is small, too little and they can't climb up, too big and it becomes very unstable."
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON I836,"Do yourself a HUGE favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this phone~! Trust me and you will be glad you did! I am looking for my 3rd phone and it will not be another i836 as the first 2 were!I have been a next el owner for 5 years and this is the WORST phone I HAVE EVER OWNED! It looks pretty YES it is sharp looking that made me want it! As a business woman I wanted something professional looking I slapped the flip down and the whole screen went blank, I though ok WELL maybe will take the battery out and try it, I took the battery door off and it broke! What did nextel do they made me buy another saying it could not be repaired! I thought ok well maybe I shut it to hard and gave it another shot, bought another and this battery door CAME broken. Ugggh a nightmare! After 4 months I DROPPED THE PHONE 1 TIME and the screen went out again. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! I have had phones that lasted a long time this one is a pretty piece of junk"
Great Apologetics!,"I forget how much I enjoy reading Lewis when I haven't read anything by him in a while. I hadn't read this book before but decided to give it a try after reading a friend's review last year, and I'm so glad that I did! Lewis takes so many of the truths of Christianity and explains them in practical ways. His illustrations and examples are wonderful, really helping his readers to understand what he is talking about. While this book is geared more toward non-Christians, there is a lot that Christians can get from reading this book. In case you can't tell, I really enjoyed this book!"
Better Sex - satusfying her,"Although the DVD had a bit of lecture and the photography was not what men would call terribly erotic, we watched it together, and were able to laugh and fast foreward thru most of the talking. My wife enjoyed the style of the photography and the scenes. Also after watching it together, she was much more open about what pleased her, and that, although seeming an indirect result, has helped our sex life. Based on those results alone we highly recommend it. Also it led us to the candida roylae videos available in adult stores, she enjoyed these a lot too.(and they are not bad from a guys viewpoint either.)"
No good,Save your money and learn Photoshop yourself..this CD is poorly presented. the author stumbles and fumbles and is hard to understand.
Dive into 'Atlantis'.,"This movie is an okay sort of movie. Not the greatest one I've seen. It does not have the greatest animation, because there all shapes. There hands are very strange too. The movie has a good plot, but is certainly not as good as, 'Tarzan' or 'Beauty and the Beast' but is certainly an enjoyable film. Michael J. Fox does a really good voice as Milo, the explorer looking to find 'Atlantis'. Well, I recommend this movie only to kids and maybe adults. It is enjoyable to kids and be sure parents you will get a thank you after the movie from your kids! They will certainly love it!"
It doesn't hold up for 4 years,"When I first purchased this vacuum, it was wonderful! It had great suction, was lightweight and very quiet. Attachments were easy to use.Our first obstacle happened when we couldn't find the right size bags in many stores. We couldn't even find them at Best Buy where we had purchased the vacuum in the first place! Then we needed to replace a belt, and had a hard time finding the one to fit as well.Now, after 4 years, the only time we get a decent vacuum from it is immediately after we change the bag. It just doesn't have good suction anymore."
Hardcore Cardio Blast,"Man is this video tough. This is a great next step once you are able to complete all three levels of the 30 day shred. I am fit, healthy and an avid sports enthusiast and this video takes every ounce of strength I can muster. If you want to get into great shape with some serious cardio exertion, then this is the video for you. I've seen dramatic increases in my endurance, stamina and lung capacity thanks to this video."
The Lovely Bones,This is the most trivial nothing that I have read all the way to the end! And the last couple of chapters proved to be the most disappointing feature of the whole book. I do not think that characters were well developed and the whole story disappointing.
The Joker is back and better/worse than ever!,"This is the best Batman cartoon to date including all the series episodes as well. The Joker is back, but wait...he has to be an impersonater right? The real Joker died decades ago...didn't he? The plot of this movie is incredible and the final gut wrenching twist will have you squirming in your seat wishing you could turn away...but for those of us who know the depraved and evil mind of the Joker, it comes as no surprize and we even begin to wonder why he didn't come with something so deranged years before. Pick this movie up but be warned it is not for the faint of heart."
Ricky Nelson Sings,Good Record with biographical material. Those of us who remember the Ozzie and Hariet show take a walk down Memory Lane.
Little boring,"I have searched all the Web for the Wiles' proof on the Fermat's Last Theorem, but never found that. This book is nice only for that"
Handy,"I'm setting up an amateur motorcycle garage with a few friends for fun. This has been pretty helpful. Some info is skewed to UK, but that's fine, the tips on dealing with tricky removal situations and general maintenance and stuff is helpful."
one tip was missing,one tip was missing from the package.... of course it was the one that I needed. Threw the other two away in disgust. Would have cost more to send it back than I paid for it in the first place. I should throw he phone away too. Motorola needs to stick to just ONE CONNECTOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Idiots. I won't ever buy another Motorola anything.
"good, but not great","The controller is a good one,but it is a little tight at first. Its bigger than the ps3 controller, but still not big enough. When i hold it i seem to be keepping my wrist in a wierd position. After awhile it just isn't that comfortable. If your used to a XBOX controller its better but not the same. overall i think its a good controller, but not great"
Disgusting,The glowing reviews for this book are obviously fake and their ratings even more so. This is disgusting. Somebody at Amazon must do something about this.
"A fast, entertaining read. Spiritualy uplifting.","I felt this was a great novel because of the fact the author included God is his plot. I enjoyed the missionary, her impact on Nate, and the peacefull ending of the book. I was able to read this book in a week. Being the slow reader that I am, books normally take me much longer than that to read. I was so into the characters, that I had to keep reading on. Forget going out to the movies, stay at home and read this book!"
Not recommended.,"I bought this book as a part of my PE exam preparation. After finishing the exam with some friends, we were so frustrated that many problems in the book were given with wrong answers. One of my friends who failed the exam once commented that it did not reflect the real exams. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seemed to be hastily written."
Funny Movie,"I personally thought the movie was ok. I originally bought it for my boyfriend because he is a big bowling fan, but it is defitnitely funny. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who dosen't neccassiraly get dry humour."
Very Good Affordable Reference,"This book has a lot to offer for a very small price. Other paperback OChem review books skimp on content -- that is not the case with this one. In some cases this book has more detail than my college text book does.It is organized as a series of questions, for example ""What is the structure of Lithium Aluminum Hydride?"" instead of the standard Topic/subtopic format. I didn't find this to be an asset, but I got used to it. The diagrams are hardly flashy, but they get the point across. I needed an Organic Chem reference because I teach an MCAT Prep course. This book is well organized and complete. I would definately recommend buying it!"
Mediocre pro-life propaganda,"This is a mediocre pro-life propaganda. I guess, the director wanted viewers to burst in tears from a number of biblical sunshine episodes and teens demonstrating abstinence and all around right father even if he behaves as a teenager. Waste of time and money."
Not bad.......,"We own this DVD and ""Bear in the Blue House.... Potty Time"" and hands-down this one is much more effective. Our daughter (22 months)seems to be captivated by a lot of the songs and scenes and has yet to grow tired of it. Within a week of watching it, she started to ask to sit on the potty, and now is comfortable sitting on it for a few minutes at a time to read a book, although we anxiously await the time when she puts two and two together!"
Blah,"There are two things very wrong with this book. Number one, the binding is horrible. The book started to fall apart right away. Second, the answers in the back of the book are not always correct. Either the best defense isn't played or the best attack isn't carried out. I've worked with tactics books where the problems are checked with a computer and those books are much less of a headache to work with."
A great band. Too bad this DVD is garbage.,"If you're an Echo and the Bunnymen fan, you no doubt are very interested in this DVD. Well, I love the band, and they sound as good as ever here. And I love concert DVDs (many good ones out there), but trust me, this one is absolutely awful. The rapid-fire editing that others here have complained about is the problem, not to mention the ridiculous overlays that supposedly add ""atmosphere."" The people who made this DVD should be taken out and shot. And the band should have the privilege of pulling the trigger."
Harmful,"Do you enjoy studying new software? Would you like to buy a big book and spend your time re-learning how to operate your word processor? Do you have extra time during your work day to figure out out to do routine tasks? If so, this is the program for you. Because Microsoft has rendered a great deal of your knowledge useless and you'll need to retrain to use this. Want to turn off grammer checking? You've got to learn how to do it again. Same goes for many, many other aspects of the program. There's so much here you don't need or want. Be smart and don't buy this product."
WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT?,"I BELEIVE THAT IT IS A SHAME THAT THE CADILLACS FINALLY GET ATTENTION AND ADMIRATION FROM THE AMERICAN MUSIC WORLD (ROLLING STONE) AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF GREAT MUSIC. WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THAT THE CD THAT IS RECIEVING SUCH LAUD IS THEIR (WITHOUT A DOUBT) WORST! CRITICS SHOULD HAVE ACCLAIMED VASOS VACIOS. THE LATTER ALBUM IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE GREATEST SKA/ROCK ALBUMS EVER. (INCLUDING ALBUMS IN ENGLISH). FABULOSOS CALAVERA IS SIMPLY OKAY. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY SOLD OUT THEIR FANS TO GO FOR A ""DIFFERENT"" STYLE. THAT ""DIFFERENT"" STYLE HAS MADE THEIR LATEST ALBUM A FEW TIERS LOWER THAN VASOS VACIOS."
Attack of the 50 Ft. PMS Woman,"Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you. Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade!"
"Cool to play with, not good for begineers","Overall I love this chess set. I love transformers, the price was right when I bought a few years ago, and it's held up to years of actual use.I didn't buy this as a collector item, and have used it on and off over the years. The pieces have held up great, no problems with durability or quality.The board itself is nothing special, just a regular checkerboard looking thing with transformer logos on it.The one compliant I have with this set is that over a long game it really becomes a pain to keep track of the pieces and which one does what.I have won and lost a game because I had lost track of what a certain piece was. In addition, it also makes it hard to teach new people how to play chess because they have to worry about learning the game as well as keeping track which piece is what, with no real good visual cues.Overall no regrets as long as the price is right."
Wood: Identification & Use (Revised & Expaned),"A friend from Mass. was visiting and brought this book for my Dad to read. Next thing I knew I was ordering a copy. After reading the cautions on some of the woods he has used in the past, he was able to figure out the hives, cough, etc that he has experienced in the past. He is also trying to pick a differnent wood to make his next clock out of. We both feel that this book is a great addition to any woodworkers library."
Awful in every respect,"Scandalously bad, totally amateurish. The sound is terrible - the orchestra can hardly be heard, 4 pretty girls (unidentified in the credits) are from time to time seen singing but can almost never be heard at all though each of them has her own mic. The camerawork is worse - Iglesias is almost always seen from only 1 angle, most of the orchestra is never seen at all, members of the audience are shown while the show is proceeding, the stage has nothing of interest. Finally, as another reviewer has noted, the entire concert lasts only 40 minutes, which is simply not believable (20,000 people did not brave the traffic of Jerusalem for a 40-minute concert), and the choice of songs we are vouchsafed is poorly organized, every song sounding pretty much like every other. I cannot imagine why Iglesias allowed this video to be released."
Nice workout shirt!,Not the highest quality ... but these tank tops are great for workout and just for wearing while laying around the house!
Conair set a new marker for what Low Quality really is,"This this is AWFUL! my hair is completly fried, and after 2 weeks it doesnt even straighten anymore.Dont waist your money"
Hair,"I have enjoyed using Nixon products for many years and have many, many compliments on my hair and always tell everyone how I achieved my thicker fuller hair at 55!!!!!!!!!"
doesnt hold much,"tthe color is good, the nets are very thin and what i dont like is that the elastic is also very very thin and doesnt hold much, I can not create a tight bun with it."
Very poor quality hardware,"I've owned a Treo 90 for just over six months now, and I've had to return it four times. Once for a broken keyboard, and the last three times because the backlight failed on the color screen.I'm disappointed because I liked the small size, the handy little keyboard, and the flip-cover that protects the keyboard and screen. Unfortunately all that nice design is fouled up by the really lousy hardware quality.My previous handheld, an old Palm III, lasted years and years. In fact when I upgraded to the Treo the old Palm was still working and I foolishly gave it away to a friend. Shouldn't have done that--now I'm gonna have to buy a replacement for the Treo 90."
this is for all you who cant get enough of that true school,"'they said it was all glitz.. i exhale, this sh*t is stale, old bidis are like new hip hop..' this album along with EVERY other PUTS release is as fresh as it gets for old school/true school.PUTS are one of the only still following the 'all break beat/no key board no drum pack' style hip hop.. as in every sound you hear is literally another piece of another song somewhere else in time. all this new industry made hip hop is horrible. if youre looking for relief from today's 'hip hop' b**ch-made music its time for you to turn to the people under the stairs.. and id suggest you start with next step. thats an album with alot of funky breaks,really fat beats and the freshest of lyrics. reminds me alot of tribe called quest back in the day. its a gem."
PURE UNADULTERATED TRASH,"NEVER GONE is what music should not be.My ears ached after listening to this nonsense in a pub.This is lousy,syrupy teen pop music at it's worst and is only meant for girls below 12 years of age.These guys are as bad as N SYNC and BOYZONE.Thank god the awful era of the boy bands has come to an end.These guys were all about style with no substance.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING OR HEARING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.Get MASTER OF REALITY from BLACK SABBATH instead."
"Nice, but a little undersized","The odd motif on the trivet doesn't really fit the rest of the 'Fiesta' style. Also, while it's heavy and robust, its enough so to make me fear for my table"
Interesting book,"This was a very good book it left you in supense through-out the book. The ending was a little too dull for me, but it is a great book. Easy to get into and everything i would recommend this book to others"
It's ok...,"I love the Sensible Foods snack line, but these are not as good as the rest of their products. I found them to be a little bland. I gave them to my vegetarian friend who loved them so maybe if you love soy nuts then you'll love them too."
The Green Mile And Its Appeal,"I read the book 6 times because I loved the story so much, and when I went to see it in the theaters it made all my invisions come true. This movie has the best story that I've seen in a while (and I'm a movie freak!). The movie will touch your heart and even me as a guy i cried every time I read the book and watched the movie. The film adaptation stays true to the Stephen King masterpiece, and deserves 80 stars, and is put up as my top ten best movies of all time! (by the way this is Frank Darabont's THIRD adaptation of a stephen King adaptation, he did Shawshank and The Woman In The Room for the nightshift collection) just to correct ya'll."
"Cute cover picture, but not a little kids book","My 3 and 4 year old just tuned this out. I thought it was a kids book, I'm 1/3 the way through, seems like some artsy thing that probably has deep social connotations or some fancy irony. It's silly and frivolous so far. I want to say lame, but I haven't finished it yet. I hope it will have some redeeming value on the last 2/3 of the book. I wish I had bought it used."
Good show but the dvd format is fullscreen,A show that is in wide screen 16:9 on tv but they release the DVDs in full screen 1.33. What idiot did this.
I love America!!!,"Sweet! This movie tells it as it was. No one owned slaves, the movie said that they worked the land freely. Sweet! Now I don't feel bad for black people anymore! And what about those British! They're so evil! No wonder Radiohead is so bad."
Art Nouveau tile C. 1890-1914,I was disappointed with the quality of this book. All the photos are either digital or downloaded from the web. There is a great variety of beautiful tiles but the images themselves are really grainy.
An absorbing tale of cultural values.,"This is a story set in both Hong Kong and America. It is, at surface, the story of cookbook author Emily Kerr and her lost daughter, Lam Fong. However there is much more to be explored in this absorbing tale of cultural values. A read for those who can appreciate cultural difference and similarity.Leann Arndt, Reviewer"
Not as pictured,"Very nice quality, good value, but colour is brown; not gray, nor black, as photographed. Slightly larger than seed pearls."
North American Falconry and Hunting Hawks (Silver Anniversary Edition) [Hardcover],Great book great buy AAAA++++++++++++++++ Has many helpful chapters for any one looking for Falconry Info.Would buy again in a heart beat.
A bit of a deception compared to the first two books,"The first two books of the Cole trilogy are awesome compared to the last one. This last book has no real adventure, not much historical background and little to the plot. The main character is constantly embroiled in life torments and finds refuge in her garden or forest. In the first books, Cole (the ancestors) are winner. In this book Cole (she) is a bit of a think small, affected by controversy about abortion rights, lost in the meanders of unrealistic love relationship. The book ends weird with her getting pregnant. I really enjoyed the first two books. They are really awesome much of the same class as ken follett or even Zola. Not this last one."
one of the worst Cannes winners,"That movie was soooo boring. An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."
Not Awful,"This syrup isn't awful. It has a very off taste that is hard to get past. I would rather eat my low carb ice cream plain than with this on top, but I think that it may be useful to add into chocolate recipes. The consistency is also quite different from a normal Hershey's chocolate syrup. It is much runnier and has a stickier (more like pancake syrup) consistency than the thick and smooth consistency that I'm used to.For no calories and no carbs, it's worth a shot. I'm sure I'll find some use for it..."
Amazingly Easy,Once this is on your computer it reminds when there are updates and has a visual status as to the current condition of your computers security... This is an all in one product package.
Don't buy this book,I do not recommend this book to anyone. Osho's views on reality are absurd. Some of the things he says sound like they come out of skeptic magazine. If you're on a spiritual path and you're already dealing with doubt do not read this book!Osho's views don't carry a feeling of hope and love with them but have more of an egotistical ring.Who set this man up to be a Guru? He's not.I'll be using the book as kindling as I cuddle up in front of the fire reading a worth while book.
Good product,I have been using this one for a few years and have tried a few other pricier eye cream and eventually decided to stick with this one. It's not expensive and it works. No miracle but it does help my eyes look younger by lifting the eye lids.
doesn't play multi-region,"Some reviewers say this plays multi-region and even explain how to make that happen. That's the only reason I bought it, to play European DVD's, but it doesn't work, so don't waste your money. It plays US DVDs fine. Now I have to buy a whole other player, should have known the price was too good to be true."
Skips On almost Every CD,I'm returning this player. It skips on almost every CD I try to play. I don't know why Sony had to reduce the quality of their CD players. I'm willing to pay a lot more. I guess I'll buy something discontinued if I have to.
Great for Tivo Users,"I bought this remote because it was the most similar to the Tivo remote I have. It's great for Tivo and I also use it for my DVD player. You do have to get a little creative with some of the buttons (Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Subtitles for DVD, etc.). High quality product, definitely recommended."
Broken...but,"One of the water tanks came broken. I fixed it myself with a little epoxy. The fan shuts off when it runs out of water, which i think is a dumb idea. Otherwise, seems to work as advertised."
Unhelpful advice,"I did not find this book helpful at all. In fact, I felt it made me more guarded and confused as to the ""proper"" way to conduct myself. I was afraid to speak. From ""timeouts"" to the meditations and visualizations to heal yourself, it left me cold. To read that you need to see it from his side and the anger he must feel makes you furious. His anger and pain is nothing compared to the person that has been betrayed."
Contains some truth but goes over the top,"I ordered this book expecting to find a well documented alternative take on what transpired on 9/11. While this book offers some interesting theories, I can't accept all that it puts on the table. I do happen to believe 9/11 was an inside job but this book is just too 'out-there' for me. The author tries to make the case for the pentagon being struck by a missile of some sort and also tries to convince the reader that there weren't even any hijackers on the planes that crashed into the world trade center but rather that they were remote-controlled. If you believe these claims then I guess this is the book for you but like I said this book presents ideas that are just too outrageous for me to believe."
long story,"If you are looking for an advanture and fast-pace novel, it's not the one. If you're a vampire-hunting fan, it'd give you a different perspective from the other books.It's also a good way to learn the East Europe. There're many detailed descriptions about the people and towns there.Overall, this book is a little bit flat for me. Maybe I was expecting to get some exciting advanture experiences from reading it."
Huey Dunbar-Cantante para el Milenio,"Este Huey si sabe como cantar, no? A mi me gusta la cancion ""Con Cada Beso"" las dos versiones. Tiene un estilo muy bueno y palabras que mueven a cualquier person especial mente la version salsa. Compren este CD, se los garatizo que lo van a disfrutar."
"Useful book, but too much generalization.","This book is fairly useful if you are wanting to begin learning about women and Ireland for the first time. . It has some useful questions at the end of each essay which can be good jumping off points for other research. However, it is too focussed on the feminist paradigm of male patriarchal dominance and female resistence to that patriarchy. That is not to say patriarchy is omnipresent in modern Ireland, but rather that the way in which it plays out is much more complex. some of the authors are quite arrogant in their discussions of Irish women, particularly those who practice Catholicism, thus the essays, while useful, must be taken with a grain of salt. If this topic interests you, ""Gender and Sexuality in Modern Ireland"" by Anthony Bradley and Maryann Gialanella Valiulis contains much more complex and nuanced essays for further reading."
Really special,"This specific movie was for one of my co-workers who has been trying to get this movie for quite a while. When I saw it on your web site, I was so pleased & so was she. She really admires Mr. Hidaka's works."
Musicians and music lovers should read this book.,"Recommended by a friend, this is a very clear, easy to follow book for anyone who likes or loves classical music and wants to get even more enjoyment out of it.As a musician myself it is very interesting to hear one of America's finest composers talk about music in a way that demystifies the listening process. To paraphrase Mr. Copland, people have no trouble going to the theater and then discussing how they felt about the performance with little or no background in the dramatic arts, yet people who go to classical music concerts are not sure they are qualified or educated enough about music to ""understand"" or form and opinion about it.This book teaches the reader that ""I don't know anything about music"" doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. By applying the information in this book one can potentially learn to hear more by becoming an active listener, which in turn increases understanding and enjoyment."
Problem Solved,"No doubt most people who buy this product plan to use it for training. It should work very well in that capacity since it certainly does get the dog's attention. It is also much kinder to the dog than those chain-type collars that are often used but should still get the same results.My problem was a dog weighing over 100 lbs and her sometime refusal to go into her pen at night. Her trick was to just lie down and not move. When she tries that now I just slip this collar over her head along with a leash and away we go, usually with just a small amount of pressure. Once she is in the pen I remove the collar; it is probably best that it not be left on except when actually being used for training or discipline."
Something smells,"When I bought the jeans they seemed to be a good price. I received them ""on time"" and right away something seemed wrong, they stunk! They smelled like they had been in sewer water. Were these made in a 3rd world country and washed in a polluted river? The first thing I did was throw them in the wash. More bad news, they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue! I had to run the wash several more times. The good news is that the pants didn't stink anymore, the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side, they fit well and look good."
standard cheep Chinese gearbox w/ motors.,"It comes in a kit. It does what it is supposed to. The gear ratio is either super fast or, if you assemble it in the other configuration, it is super slow. No happy middle. Probably better off getting the more expensive one with more than two gear configurations."
Look Elsewhere,"Unlike the other review, I find the sound quality pretty good. I've had it for about six years but I've had to send it back to the distributor for repairs to the CD player, once and now, within three years and with not very frequent use, the CD player is acting up again. The box is great, the components are cheap."
Mac Compatible!,"I've been using the Coolpix 2500 for a few months now and I'm thrilled that I chose it. Here's why:- Fully compatible with a macintosh computer and iPhoto. Just plug the camera into a free USB slot and turn it on to the view mode.- Excelent picture quality (2MP). Both printed (up to 8x10) as well as computer images are crisp clear and bright.- Senic settings that actually work! I've tried taking the same picture with each seprate pre-set and got different results. Even better, the recomended setting was the best.- Small, swivel lens (for protection and intesting angles), easy to see LCD monitor and price.The only things I would improve are:- Faster response time when turning the camera on- Shorter pause between pictures.For a point and shoot, I don't think you can do much better in this price range (especially if you're a mac user)."
The Band Left the Lost Riots Behind,"When Hope of the States came out with their debut album, ""The Lost Riots,"" I was the one singing its praises. I waited for ""Left"" by Hope of the States to go down far enough to where I could get it for $15 (shipping included).Expectations were very high... and I don't think I have listened to a bigger disappointment. I think the band has taken a few steps back by creating an album that sounds like Interpol. I was wanting an improvement on ""The Lost Riots."" I'm okay with something in a completely different direction. It just so happens that direction has already been done by an array of bands with the first one coming to mind being Interpol.This isn't a bad album. It just isn't a very good album. Perhaps I can revisit this album in a couple of months. Sometimes all it takes is a couple more listens to enjoy an album or to see something in it you didn't see before. ""Left"" may have that potential, but for now it is a disappointment."
no good,"I love this product and regularly buy it, but this must be a defective jar... it doesn't smell the same or work as well."
"Some good, some bad","This coffeemaker makes a great pot of coffee & the advance timer function is a real advantage.Waking up to coffee already made is mighty convenient. The functions are relatively easy to program, though the image of machine w/names of parts should have been put on the facing page of the usage instructions.The water gauge has constant air bubbles (very annoying) so amount of water has to be reckoned by the pot. The ""finished brewing"" alert is so faint that if one isn't directly next to the pot,it can't be heard. Minor annoyances,I grant,but need to be addressed."
great finishing sander,"This was the first power sander that I bought and I've been generally pleased with it. I can get an incredibly smooth finish with it and it manages to collect most (but not all) of it's dust. I also like the fact that it uses standard sanding paper -- no need for special paper, some of which can get quite expensive.I should point out that this is truly a finishing sander. I wrongly thought I could just put lower grit sandpaper on it and use it for more aggressive sanding. Not so. But it does a great job at what it was designed for -- very fine sanding."
Great stuff!,"I don't even like zombies, but TWD is one of the best shows on tv. With the introduction of the Governor, Rick and the gang have an adversary just as intresting as they are. Keep it comming!"
Aziz. Shihab,"I was attracted to look for out of print books by Aziz. Shihab. I was intrigued by the fact that he did a serious study of Carl Gustave Jung the german psychologist who coined the term ""synchronicity"" .. this book is much different than the focus on the lifetime work of Jung, but I am certain this guy is perhaps the greatest living modern mystical author."
Watch Out,"Just wanted to note that after viewing the entire series at a friends house, I, too had wanted a copy of them. Great information and from a fairly reliable and somewhat unbiased source. I have attempted to purchase the series now 3 different times. Each time, (different suppliers) have always mailed only ONE disc to me (even charged my account $80...for one disc?). Just wanted to give a heads up and Watch Out for any 'missing discs'....heck, it might be a conspiracy.......someone does not want me to have the entire series on disc. I have let the suppliers know, but, they continue to list the product. Hope everyone else is getting what they ordered. Question the Answers.......Peace Out."
Undeservedly neglected,There certainly are some gorgeous moments in the first two movements of the third symphony. If the final movement sounds a bit too much like Copland one can say that of so many composers. I heartily recommend these enjoyable works. Definitely worthwhile listening.
Great book but the edition is awful,"This is a great (awesome) book but the problem is that the edition is horrible...there is even an error on the index! And the introduction is a ""copy-paste"" paragraph from wikipedia! In my opinion this is one of the worst examples of non existant editorial work."
Excellent Water Bollte,"Been using the water bottle for over year now, and I been a satisfying using product. I bring my bottle to the Gym every time."
Audiovent,"The CD by Audiovent, ""Dirty Sexy Knights in Paris"" is the best CD I have heard in a LONG time. I really like the songs ""The Energy"", and ""Looking Down"". The song, ""Looking Down"", is about how the band doesn't need their famous brothers to help them to be succesful in the music business. And that they'll make it. To me, they will make it with this CD! It is the best and people should go out and buy the CD! (And I'm not 12, I'm actually turning 14. I only used the kids review because I don't have a password to write a review on the adult part!)"
More than 25 minutes longer version,"... this unabridged version is ... is more than 25 minutes longer than the 1958 recording by the composer himself. The total time is about 74 minutesIt is superb epic music, of the many compositions Villa-Lobos wrote one of his best! The only thing I don't like are some short wordless vocalises to imitate birds.But the real songs (sung by Renee Fleming or the choir) which appear like intermezzos on certain places in the driving orchestral music are beautiful. The recording was released before in 1996 on another label (Consonance)."
"A good starting point, for a Generic Fantasy world","GURPS Fantasy is good place to start a campaign, if the GM lacks the time or talent to build a world from scratch. There's enough detail to provide a lot of room for campaigns with a lot of different 'flavors'.The background material can be used to generate adventure seeds, and make the world seem more ""real"" to the players.For those that don't want a generic ""high fantasy"" setting, this might not work. It does have some nice twists - like Goblins being a viable character race, not a ""cannon fodder"" monster."
"It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again","I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
A landmark...of course,"Led Zeppelin II is often cited as the definitive hard rock album, and it is true than within its nine tracks one can discern the origins of all sorts of sacred metal traditions: the sexual frenzy ('Whole Lotta Love'), mystical fantasies ('Ramble On'), breathtaking guitar solos ('Heartbreaker') and just plain heavy riffing all through. This effort actually does feel a bit truncated in comparison to their first album, which sprawled out a bit more. Here they've managed to cut some more succinct, yet just as seminal slices of hard rock. In typical Zeppelin fashion, there is an emphasis on subtlety (such as the jazzy verses on 'What Is and What Should Never Be') as well as on bombast and volume. But probably the main thing that most listeners will remember here is the sheer energy. Highly recommended."
humor me.,"OH MY GOD YOU PPL! rob zombie ranks 4.5 stars? i dont see how that can happen -- this cd is totally hollow, has bad music, the lyrics are the worst ive ever heard on ANY cd -- ""dead i am the one, exterminating son | slippin thru the trees, strangling to breeze | dead i am the sky, watchin angels cry | while they slowly turn, conquering the worm""? thats not even the worst , just check out demonoid phenomenon or superbeast. ugh. beg you dont waste ur money on this freakshow. rob zombie's a joke. a bad joke. im outta here."
As perfect as I could imagine!,A great product that makes it easy to get absolutely perfect measurements. It is a thin metal template with tiny slots for marking the project. Marks in increments as precise as 1/64. Also has scales for 32nd's and 16th's. Hold the red bar against the edge of the project and locate the slot representing the distance you need. Works with suitably thin scribes but also with a reasonably sharp regular pencils and mechanical pencils.
Auto Record Book,"If you are a gearhead like me, you are looking for a way to capture all maintenance aspects of your vehicles. This book is what you are looking for. I routinely maintain five vehicles and at time it's easy to loose track of what services are due and when you performed previous maintenance. I highly recommend this style record book for anyone that wants to keep their vehicles maintained. You can even record every fuel stop, cost, mileage, MPG and location."
Bass Basics,This bass book would be a great starting point for any one just begining to play. All the basics are there and the C.D. that it comes with is helpful. But the book could have gone farther than the very simplistic bass lines that it taught. A very basic guide that would require you to buy another book immediatly.
Yet another gawddamn double dip.,"Why do the studio's keep churning out movies without any real difference?I mean Casino was known at the time of release to have been cut down to get an R rating. But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.SO what else does this ""new"" double DVD have? Alternate Ending? No. Double disc? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film? Yup.Waste your money if you want, I smell a 20 year Special Edition waiting in the wings.Thanks.Oh and if this review seems like a copy of the one I did for GoodFellas...it's because it is...only slightly different.B."
Well worth it,"This is a great book. I'm not a huge hockey fan but I felt awful about this tragedy. This book describes the family's amazing ability to forgive, despite such a tragic loss. I enjoyed the sneak peak into what goes on among teammates and seeing the more personal side of hockey. Very well written."
Scarlett DVD,"This movie is fantastic, wonderful story line, acting supberb, hated to have it end , Gone With The Wind is my ALL time favorite, now I have a SECOND all time favorite. It is a MUST BUY."
Worked fine for a time,Used a lot of batteries. Then the vibrate feature stopped. No fun without the vibration. Will never buy another one.
Dull in a week,"Bought this item and it arrived in one day which was very impressive considering I live in British Columbia. The knife looked great and was extremely sharp out of the box, but within just a couple uses I thought I could feel the blade getting duller. Telling myself it must be in my head as there were so many good reviews and other people telling me what a great product this was, I put it out of my mind. The next day I bought some dense rye bread and thought I would try cutting it with my new Global knife - even though I knew it was not a bread knife, I figured it would be fine... It did cut through the bread, however after about 6 slices I really noticed how dull the blade was...I could not believe it! Now after a few more uses on nothing harder than a carrot, it is as dull as a bread knife...I can literally slide it across my palm with no fear of cutting myself. I would like to know what the return policy is."
"Garbage, pure and simple","The Sci-Fi channel should be ashamed for unleashing this idiotic, sophomoric nonsense onto the viewing public. Supposedly ""edgy"" and ""gritty,"" the characters are as weak as the stories. A minor note to the filmmakers: get a tripod! They don't cost that much, you pathetic hacks. The only ones who will enjoy this are drooling children who don't know Sci-Fi from a skin rash."
maybe for a hampster on a flat surface,"Got one of these for my large, old, arthritic dog. The cats wouldn't even use it inside on a carpeted surface. It worked a few times outside next to the back of the SUV on a flat surface, but when I used it a few times on a slightly skewed surface away from home, the thing completely fell apart, with the dog on it. Luckily she wasn't hurt, but I can't say the same for my shoulder after having to hoist her rump into the car (which was also embarrassing). I really wish someone would make something lightweight yet durable, that did not require connections to the car, and that was wider. It slips on any outside surface, forcing one to hold it against the car in position, and the steps are way too shallow for most any critter."
Agartha,"I read this book when it first came out, I was totally inspired to put the words into practice, and guess what, it works. This book took me into a very real world of plant deva's, non local relationships, and gentle, lovely true advice. I've bought many copies for friends, all of whom enjoyed it as much as I did. I loved following the authors experience of growth as she first, as a novice meditator, meets her guide ""Mentor"", and later shows the wisdom she herself has gained from the whole experience of channeling. I just loved this book. Thanks"
Great Disc!,"If you are a fan of the Afghan Whigs this cd is a must have. It is a lot more rock than I would expect from Mr. Dulli, but that isn't a bad thing. Songs Cigarettes and Domani stand out and are surrounded by great tracks through out the album. No one fuses rock and R&B quite like Greg Dulli, and if the new Twilight Singers album is reminicent of these recordings we are in for in for a treat."
My old HD400's sound just as good.,"Gave these headphones a try at Amazon's <$50 price. The biggest problem is they sound no better than the $20 Sennheiser HD400's that I have owned for years. They also had a bass rattle during a heavy bass passage. During the bass guitar solo in Rush's ""Limelight"" the left earpiece had a rattle. Have listened to this song hundreds of times on my HD400's and never experienced the rattle. Never noticed the rattle on other songs.I rated the comfort 2 stars. They just clamp to tight for my tastes. The plastic they use for the earcups and headband just feel cheap. Thank to Amazon's generous return timeframe I returned them after I gave them a through breakin which many folks say they need. To me they sound just OK, not good enough to keep."
heartwarming regency spoof,"Ms. Lansdowne leads us a merry chase into a regency love story - actually, four regency love stories. Four love stories in 256 pages is a bit over the top, but everything in this delightful spoof is a bit over the top. Ms. Lansdowne has complete command of her period, and proceeds to demolish everything from Almack's to the quizzing glass in this amusing and heartwarming romp."
"Cool gadget, short cord",Works relatively good. The REALLY BIG PROBLEM is that the wire is too short. I regret buying this headphone. I will probably break it soon because it is too short and I stretch it all the time
what a fine gift!,I purchased this as a gift and it is beautiful. It looks very rich and comes in a fancy box. The eco feature is very cool; no batteries ever needed.
A little bit of complexity Change,This book explore the ways and difficulties about change organization in a systemic perspective. It's very incisive and gabe some tools and advices too.
Not working in Car,"After recording CD using Windows 7 media play based on the article eHow, the recorded CD can play on the computer. However, it is not able to play in the Honda Civic original car stereo. A big waste of time of shopping, recording, and etc since my goal is to play audio lessons during my commute. Called Sony recording media customer service and was told that I have to pay for return shipping to get repaired. I am sure it is the way the media was made, and cannot exchange to CDR or something. The customer service told me that they did not care if the recorded CD play on car stereo or not. Buyers for car stereo should stay away. Customer service is bad and cannot provide a reasonable solution."
Before He Cheats,"The life of Carrie Underwood exists within that one song. This is the type of music she needs to sing to succeed. Not sappy, construde ballads like ""Whenever you Remember.' Beautiful girl, lacking my interest only because of poor song choice."
The True Ninja Game,"Over all, I liked the gameplay quite a bit, the environment is a bit messy that's all. Most Activision games I played are liked that for some reasons, but their games are always some of my personal favorites. I dig Ninja stuff and played most of the Ninja games made earlier, but all I have to say none was like this. You can actually stealth and stuff for the first time. Pretty much like Metal Gear's style and I personally think that's where they got the idea from. But overall, they did a good job with storyline, re-playable... I don't know, it's quite a long game and quite time consuming. Anywayz, if you like ninjas, get this. You'll like it at least..."
Who is Scabbers?,"Rowling amazes us again. I think I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. The true (! ) identity of Scabbers is shocking, amazing, and incredible. Obviously if you've made it this far in the Harry Potter series, you shouldn't stop here!"
WASTE OF MONEY!,"I recently purchased this item to help eliminate a hard water/sulfur buildup in my toilet, after scourering the toilet and starting with a clean surface, the buildup returned! This product has not made any difference at all, complete waste of money!!"
Falls Flat,"I have heard over and over how good this book is. I have finally decided to read it, I am about 2/3 of the way through it, and I am not at all impressed. Maybe because this is not my first rodeo... I'm familiar with the theme, I've read many other works dealing with racial inequalities... For me, this one falls flat. I'm hoping ""the good part"" is in the last third."
Good writing tips but not applicable to dynamic workplace,"Some of the basic writing tips regarding word choice, sentence length, reading level, and formatting are great. The rest might apply if your company has never documented its policies and procedures before or if you work in a static workplace (government office?) where policies or procedures are added or changed only a couple of times a year (do people really still print these on paper?) However, if you work at a dynamic, constantly changing company that must respond to thousands of different customer queries a day, much of the advice is not applicable."
It's not that good......,"It's not that good cause well.... the graphics ar just as bad if not worse than the origanal and the gameplay is dffinitly worse and so is the sound so I would stick with ""Diablo"" classic"
does what it says to protect your gear,"I bought this as a second insert to go inside my F-2 bag.The padding is nice and thick and the velcro mates up with the velcro inside of the bag.Only slight negative is that the foam inserts in the sides are not sealed on the bottom. I am not sure if this is to allow a couple of them to be removed (if you only want front and back protection) or what, but it seemed a little unfinished for the price.The Canon 5D Mark III with an attached 50mm lens fits nicely in the pocket with the ability to be easily removed."
good daylight general purpose camera,"hmmmpc-cam 750 has it all.. video, audio, webcam, pictures.and it works fine.. with one exceptionlighting!pictures are either too dark or too brightdonno what is the problemworks ok in daylight but not otherwiseso you have to take care in that regardalso it is a 1.3MP camera.. only interpolated to 2.1MPit has a good sensor.. still does not perform as well as expected...i would suggest you better buy a HP model available for $180 with optical zoom, lcd and memory slots than this one at $110"
Can't get support,"This product appears to have real value in it. The parts of the software that I can get to work have the potential to be great tools for improving your singing. Unfortunately, the meat of the product, the singing lessons, will not run on my computer and I have been unsuccessful at getting technical support for the product. Over the past week, I have sent emails and called durring business hours. No one was present to answer my calls and never returned the emails of voice messsages I left. At this point I intend to return the software."
Low Impact and Lots of Fun,"I bought this DVD hoping to find a fun dance workout that would get my heart rate up. Well, Cardio Salsa is lots of fun, but my heart rate didn't get above 130 the entire workout. I did burn a couple of hundred calories though and it definitely kept me moving.The dance combinations were fairly easy in the beginning when she takes you through the seperate steps and got pretty intricate when you put them all together. I have NO rhythm, but was able to follow along with most of it. I imagine after three or four viewing, I will be able to follow along better and that should increase my calorie burn and help get my heart rate a little higher. I felt like I got a nice light workout that made me sweat. There wasn't a lot of jumping around, which my knees definitely appreciated.This is definitely going into heavy rotation at my house."
Ugggggggghhhh!,"3001 attempts to explain much of what has happened since 2001, a book whos' lack of explantation made it so popular to me.Mankind finds superior intellect in the universe and in this book we attempt to understand ""its'"" purpose. This is the last of a four book set, preceded by 2010 & 2061, books that shouldn't have been written. Over four books you finally reach a pinnacle, that does nothing more than disappoint. The ending is similar to Independence Day (the movie). Computer virus wins over are ancestral guides? Ughhh!It earns one star because it set up a great premise, but could not deliver."
awesome episodes,this is the fourth disc to season 2 part 2. this disc contains the first couple episodes from season 3. this is an awesome collection of episodes. if you have not seen season thre then i recommend you do
looks aren't everything,For my 2nd guitar I bought this model. I gave this guitar 2 stars because of how it looks. It has a very nice finish and looks very good. That's about all the positives I can see. Mine developed a crack under the neck about 2 months after I got it. Unfortunately Rogue has no manufactures warranty. So now I'm stuck with a defective guitar. I would highly recommend buying a 3rd party warranty if you do decide to buy this model. I would recommend the Epiphone DR 100 at the same price over this model. That is what I got to replace this one and I am much happier with it. Easier to play and sounds better plus it has a lifetime warranty.
Picture quality dark.,"We love the Avonlea series and were willing to pay for a good quality DVD.Season 3 and 4 are both dark in all scenes that are not outside. Plus, there are 2 identical discs in Season 4 so we are missing one entire disc that has 4 episodes on it. It makes me wonder if these aren't a poorly duplicated product made cheaply and quickly for pure profit."
"Expensive, Poor Quality",I bought a 50 foot flexogen hose. It is easily the most expensive hose I ever bought. Also it is the worst hose I ever bought. Water comes out everywhere except where I need it.
"basic needs met, advanced features expected","the phone's clear, feels good, neat features. it still doesn't support address book syncing with any software so i haven't bought the cable yet. also the battery drains way to fast, if i leave the phone on and maybe make one or 2 short calls it is dained within a day. i can not find larger batteries anywhere yet either. i subscribed to cingular video and xm radio on it and it's great! make sure you get unlimited bandwidth or else you're going to pay hundreds! :P they had an error on my statement i needed fixed and had to call 2 months in a row now since they didn't get it right yet."
Basic training book,"In my opinion this book gives you a basic training of view camera. In particular it explains very well all view camera movements, but I would have preferred if there had been more details in those explanations, with more examples and other. Another point that I would have preferred different was the sequence of the chapters. In firsts chapters where is explained camera structure, accessory and other, there are too many reference at camera movements, that you haven't known yet, because chapter of movements is after.Anyway, this book, is well written and easy comprehensible, but in my opinion in some parts is too condensed; so my rate is 4 stars."
cheap & a waste of cash,The first time I tried to use this it bent. I wld strongly suggest you do not buy this.
"Disappointing, Sucks...Need I Say More","Horrible, sucked my will to live..........if the possessed plants did not get me first. Long, boring huge parts missing. Stephen King gave this book high regard he must have been on crack when he read it."
Awesome,Needed these for a party ordered on Friday the party was Wednesday night they were here by noon Wednesday... I absolutely love them
more like a hummer than a porsche,"I've had this for about a month now, and it's worked great (I'm still a little wary after my previous external drive crashed on me). It's a bit clunky, and I'm not crazy about having to plug it in separately, but it's so nice to have 300 GB of extra space to work with. It's a great value for the drive size and price."
fiskars 7854 axe,"I have burned wood for over forty years and have used many different types of hand splittig tools, prefered a 3lb single bit axe. I purchased a Fiskars 7854 splitting axe two weeks ago and am frankly amazed at what it will do. I burn hard maple and this axe splits even the toughest pieces with ease. I estimate it has reduced my splitting time by at least 30%. Now if someone could just do something about the mud here in the northeast. Do not hesitate, buy one, you will be thrilled with it. One note; you will have a tendenancy to short strike with it at first, WATCH YOUR FEET!!!! It is now four years and fifty face-cord of wood later, still the best hand splitting tool I have ever owned. A few strokes with a flat file to shine up the edge and split away."
"Effective STL, More effective STL, More More Effective STL","What happened to the day when an author possessed the ability to convey an ideal within the confines of one book. It is my opinion that Scott Meyers is only out to sell as many books as possible. The next time Scott Meyers decides to write a book; he definitely needs to spend a little more time so that maybe once in his life he will be able to offer a complete product. I was left with the impression that I had purchased the first few chapters of a good book. I guess I will have to wait around for Scott Meyers to finish what he started. What I mean by this is, Scott, When are you going to write More Effective STL? Are you going to make a trilogy of STL and follow More Effective STL up with More More Effective STL? Also, I am still waiting for More More Effective C++ to hit the shelves at $--.-- a pop. Pass this book up and look for something more complete on the STL."
DO NOT! waste your time or money on this movie.,"I do not know what these people were on, when giving this movie 4 or 5 stars. This movie seems to have been made on a $5 budget and filmed/directed by an 8 year old using a handicam. The ""action"" scenes if you want to call it that are just lame and no special/effects whatsoever (just blobs of ketchup).There is not a single minute in this movie that is worth watching........"
not safe,I bought one at Target - my daughter was very excited and eager to jump on. Right after she sat on it and move foward it tipped right a way. We returned it in 5 minutes.
maybe I read the abridged version,"I kept reading this book thinking I would eventually understand why she loved her husband, or going to the colony, or anything. It never became clear. I'm thinking that perhaps I read the abridged version since this story was just a mass of disasters happening one right after the other, with no real reason shown for why the main character had such passion for the people and the places in her life.If you want to read this book, make sure you get the full version. All these great reviews must come from somewhere."
Had to grow on me....but love it now :),"It took some time to really appreciate this movie. I guess, I was burnt out from movie watching but I have to say now this is my go-to movie, comfort movie, fall asleep to movie. When I need a good feeling or good laugh, I really enjoy this one. Best part of the film is during the rehearsal dinner and Aunt Geneva sings, ""Let's Get Down Tonight"". So funny, she's a good actress anyway. I really liked her on ""Half and Half""....Anyway, I like this one!"
Not for enjoyment listening,"I have a lot of headphones. And have had for many years. I have these, and love them. These are closed-ear, clinical, precise sounding cans. They are hot on your ears. They are harsh. They are good for mixing recordings because they consolidate a lot of listening experiences. When you're mixing music, you need to listen on a variety of sources, sources you expect your music to be heard on: iPod earbuds, car stereos, AM radios, Disco sound systems etc. These are great because they relentlessly show detail. If your mix sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything. BUT If you are looking for a comfortable, moving listening experience; check out Grado. Audiophile quality, rich and beautiful. Recordings mixed with these Sony's will sound spectacular on Grados. These are an incredible tool, but they are built for a purpose, and it's work, not pleasure."
verrrrrry heavy straws,How in the WORLD does a package of plastic straws that sells for $1.19 weigh in at 84.24 lbs?????? This is an obvious error that results in shipping charges in excess of $100. No one will be dumb enough to purchase these straws until this is corrected.
DO NOT BUY EVER!!!!!!,"Stopped working after a week. Sound quality is horrible. If you are buying for the microphone, DON'T. People can't understand you. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!"
Very pretty,"I really like the glass. It is advertised as 13""x 30"" overall but it is only 12 x 29. This is for a bathroom window for privacy so the size was a little disappointing. Also on the metal frame there is a paint chip which is not a big deal because I will touch it up but it should not be there. The glass work itself is very nice."
Opera Goes Pop,"John McCormack was one of the most popular singers of his day. He was primarily known for his operatic tenor, but he also had great success with his recordings of popular songs. This disc collects a number of his more popular recordings. I would have preferred a larger sampling of his work from the 1910s, but it does have several classics, including ""Somewhere a Voice Is Calling"" (which NARAS has inducted into their Recording Hall of Fame) and ""The Lost Chord"" (one of the most popular songs of the turn of the twentieth century)."
Fireflies,"I have to admit that I am pretty disappointed in this CD. I waited for three years and multiple delays. When I saw Faith in Vegas in August 2004 she said the CD would be out Fall of 2004. Anyway, I could not believe the first track Sunshine &Summertime it was just fluff along with Fireflies, We've got nothing to prove and the Lucky One. These should have never made it on the CD, Faith is so much better then this lame material. I also felt there was not even one song that really struck me like in her previous Cd's, like Breathe, This Kiss and most of Cry. This CD is a very poor attempt at getting on country radio and this hurts me to say as I really like Faith Hill but save your money, Fireflies is not worth it."
Mental aspect of game,This book develops the mental aspect of this wonderful sport. Some tips come naturally but it does no harm (and it actually is quite helpful) to read the once in a while.
promising but didn't deliver,"Francesca is not my favorite of the Bridgerton sisters. She's very aloof and that makes it hard to feel much of anything for her. I did like Michael as a character, but I'm not sure Francesca deserves him. And I thought the part of the book where they are having non-stop sex while he attempts to woo her, just ridiculous. If she truly felt so guilty about her dead husband, wouldn't those feeling extend to sleeping with his cousin? Disappointing."
Xenosaga,The Xenosaga Strategy Guide came with an outer protective cover (which was nice as it keeps the book from getting destroyed) and a sound track; although the sound track was not something I personally cared for. The book was well-written; it gives you the information needed to get through the game. I gave it three stars because it is just the typical strategy guide.
Wii Play,"Some of the games are goofy but fun, like the cow race. Others are regular sport like the shooting and pool. Overall worth it when you get it with the Wii remote package.Wii Play with Wii Remote"
1930's,"don't be fooled by the modern day apperance of this one, it was published in the thirties. So, that being said it may have been a great guide to charm for my grandmama, but It has little relevency to our modern customs and lifestyles. There was a whole chapter on ""which hat to select to go with what frock"" I don't think I've ever even worn a frock. there were som e useful parts but I'd keep looking if i were serioulsy looking for a book on etiquitte and charm."
Review of theTimex Women's Ironman Sleek 50/100 watch (T5B721),"I have recently bought the timex woman's Ironman watch.Too which i took this with me, whilst watching my other half compete in Ironman Austria 9th of July 2007.I found this watch particularly handy as following the race I was able to keep up to date times, which i relayed home as the Ironman site was very slow and at one point stopped giving up-dated times.I would strongly advice the purchase of this watch not only for the features but also for the sleek, comfortable and stylish must have watch."
"Not as good as Sharon Creech's others, but good nonetheless","This book was a disappointment after others such as Walk Two Moons, Bloomability, and Chasing Redbird, but it still draws you in and is a story worth having."
Disappointed Texan,"I read the reviews and bought this Toshiba SD-1600 DVD player rather than Sony. I am disappointed and would return it if I still could. I can hear the motor during silent parts of the movies, and the zoom is not very advanced compared to newer models from other manufacturers. Also, this player doesn't seem to handle transitions of layers very well. There is always a very noticeable pause. I also had problems watching 'For Love of the Game' (no scratches) as the player just stalled on one scene toward the end and would not advance no matter what I did. I ended up having to restart the movie, and watch it from the next scene onward. I haven't tried 'The Matrix' yet, but understand that it gives DVD players a good workout. Thinking about the Toshiba SD-1600? Think again and buy the Sony or another maker."
A bunch of fluff with catchy titles,"This book is a an easy read that provides a few points and snickers on the topic. However, Eva Shaw provides way too much common sense instructions, which are redundant, boring and pretty much pointless to the topic of the book. Here is one of many examples: ""Every writer needs to take several breaks. Go for a short walk, right now, if only for five minutes. Get out of the office during your writing day. When you're walking, straighten your posture, breathe deeply and swing your arms. Go once around the garden, up and down a flight of stairs or to the end of the block and back. If you're absolutely, positively not the type to walk, stretching is also great to get the brain cells functioning again.""I guess I'm just not a writer, because I think this paragraph was a rather pointless filler."
Undercover Blues is the spy spoof side splitter of the year.,"Here it is...a James Bond 'knock-off' rip-roaring, tongue tickling, spy spoofing, movie ...and if you can say that without tripping, then this is a must see movie. Like Tango & Cash, Turner & Quaid find themselves a once again rehired CIA spy duo out to save the 'World'. Along the way, they run into a scene stealing 'El Fuento' co-star. Grab the popcorn for this one."
Caveat EMPTOR!!!,"If this DVD IS based on the 'Broadway' production and NOT the 'Hollywood' one........and I suspect it is, based on the 'description'.....you'll be VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!The sound quality is abominable. The lack of 'mobility' on the part of the cameras is atrocious. The sets are disagreeable.I bought it from Hollywood Video, back when it first came out. And immediately returned it to the store as totally unacceptable.I still treasure the VHS tape."
Not Well Made,"I really hate to give something a negative review, but this product, while very cleaver, is so poorly made that it fell apart almost immediately. I was very disappointed."
My 16 mos old loves it!!,Kept my son entertained. It is educational and the music was fun.Would definitely buy more of the dvd's.It is fun.
Little Tikes Push & Ride the Perfect Gift,"I purchased this toy for my nephew's first birthday. It turned out to be his favorite gift above all the others, including a little car that he could be pushed in.My husband put it together in about 15 minutes with no problems. Everything went together easily and nothing broke while inserting the pieces. It even comes with extra wheels in case you need them later on. My nephew isn't quite walking by himself yet and this gave him that little bit of security that he needed. He was even pushing it around in the grass with no problems. It is sturdy enough that even with him being wobbly it did not tip over. His legs aren't quite long enough to touch the ground yet but I am sure he will be happy with it for a long time to come.I would definitely recommend this to any one with a small child."
"Easy to use, great camera","I have only one complaint, it didn't come with a case! Other than that its a great camera for the money!"
good book and great movie,"I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read."
Microsoft mouse,"I bought and reviewed the Microsoft 69k-00001 Natural wireless laser mouse 6000. It does fit my hand like a glove, no wrist pain. Sometimes the mouse does not acknowledge when I have clicked it though. That becomes very frustrating when you have a job that you are on the computer all day."
quite good,"I think Martin is a great fantasy writer, this is a quite good books, and not only good, because we were waiting for years this book and so we were full of expectation, that's all!bye"
great economical fryer,"simple, straight forward and low priced. this fryer was made for people who fry once a week or less.pre-heat for 10 minutes and you're ready to fry at 375 degrees which just happens to be the perfect temp. for frying most foods. use a splatter screen to catch any popping grease & help control odors.the plastic lid is nice for storing oil for re-use.if you fry a lot, you might want to consider paying more for a model with basket & temp controls etc., however the chef's fryer is perfect for the infrequent fry cook."
Training your memory,"If the readers intention is to play a game of memory then this selection of poems can play the trick. But if your expectation is to have a first-rate selection of poems, then this book will run short of your objective."
Bland Bland Bland,"I am a long-time fan of REM. I was once a purist, but I have come to really enjoy the group's transformations over the last 10 years (I disagree with evaluations that mark their highpoint at *Automatic* and downplay later innovations). But my god, this new album is something I could not have imagined from the group: a bland, uninteresting, soul-lessly overproduced snooze-fest. Pay careful attention to those reviews that note the album's ""polish"" and prepare yourself to hear the sounds of Buck and Mills (and perhaps Stipe himself) mixed out of existence. This could be Stipe with any old band-for-hire, and its total lack of edge or texture makes it perfect waiting-room music. Now, REM gets to make a mistake now and then, so no problem; but let's not say this is a good album. It's the sound of something good going very -- and let's hope temporarily -- wrong."
Depressing,"Talk about looking for love in all the wrong places. This woman has an unerring radar for obnoxious,over wrought,nutty men. And the killer is that she was still attracting these losers in her 50's.I was exhausted just reading about it.She and Ted Turner actually sound kind of pitiful.Both had dismal childhoods and are still struggling with them 5 decades later.I found it amazing they stayed in marriage counseling 7 out of the 8 years they were married. The ""therapists"" must have made a killing off these two self absorbed neurotics."
Lasted only a few months of light use.,"As the title says, it started to fail after only a few months of occasional use on hardwood and linoleum floors as a secondary vacuum. The tiny wheels jammed and fell out. It didn't have much sucking power either."
Okay,This one is not quite my cup of tea but it is a good mystery. I am just not fond of mob movies. It will keep you guessing especially if you miss some very important clues. It will keep you guessing as to who done it. There is a lot of language and violence so if you're squeamish you may want to pass this one up. All in all it's a good mystery.
Good quality,"I needed a white, mostly cotton hoodie just so I could tie dye it. This one is nice and thick, doesn't feel cheap at all."
Disappointing,"I have many PC products, and this is the worst of the lot. 7529 feels great in your hands, and the soft start is nice.But now the problems. The trigger lock takes a lot of getting used to. Can be very hard to lock. The knob on the front for locking the depth gauge is coming off. It's a plastic knob pressed onto a brass insert, and when you tighten the knob it pulls away from the insert. The electronic brake stopped working, and the height lock came loose. I've only used it a few times, and it seems to be falling apart!I've heard many of these same problems from fello woodworkers."
"Dancing Super, Story Not So Much","If it wasn't for the fact I've always enjoyed watching a good tap dancer, from Fred Astaire to Bill Robinson to Gene Kelly on here to Gregory Hines, I wouldn't have sat through all 111 minutes of this turkey. That's what the story is - a turkey with a bunch of angry, surly, unlikable characters who are no fun to listen to.What this REALLY is - and this part I like - is an excuse for Hines and fellow hoofers to strut their stuff. In fact, Hines puts on one of the best exhibitions of tap dancing I have ever seen. What's really fun is to see him and a some old men, former great dancers in their day, all together in a number or two. That's great stuff.So, if want to enjoy some super dancing, check this out."
Mostly disappointing,"Although my feelings aren't quite as strong as the first reviewer's, I was also disappointed with the kit. It's a fairly complex building job, and the resulting rocket isn't great, and is decidedly fragile, good for 3 or 4 launches max before needing extensive repairs. It's performance is mediocre at best."
Classic ETID,"If you liked their previous work, do yourself a favor and get this album. It's hard hitting classic Every Time I Die. If you take the time to pay attention the lyrics they are as meaningful as always, but you can also take a break and just rock out (and it would be difficult to find a better CD this year to rock out to)."
Pretty heavy adapter,"Since there is no extension wire for this, we have to connect it directly to the terminal. I am finding it difficult to use with my bose speaker's adapter(which is again equally heavy). It also smells a lot while in use. Again, you can use it with only one device at a time."
"A great film, but as a comedy, worn out slightly.","When I went over to my friend Sam's birthday sleepover, a lot of stuff happened. Everyone teased me because of my height and bad swordsman skills (don't ask), I learned how to play poker, and also, we popped in a movie called THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN.I, intrigued by the film, decided to investigate the series. Two months later, I then bought the boxed set with my allowance. I put in THE PINK PANTHER, and liked it alot. I especially loved Peter Sellers and David Niven's performance. Blake Edwards is the Alfred Hitchcock to comedy. I also loved the title sequence. The humor is focused more on Peter Sellers stupidity. It's sort of one of those movies that are hilarious, yet you never laugh-out-loud.In all, great performances and decent direction make a great comedy.Sincerely,- Ryan Michaels- Fourth-grader- Nine-year old- Further info restricted (requests of the parents)"
Caramels,These are delicious caramels and great when melted and poured over vanilla ice cream or angel food cake. If you love caramels - you will love these. Enjoy!!!1
lexmark 3200,"i have had this printer for 4yrs and it has finally died. i had the same problems as another review --- always jamming, taking a pad of paper and not one at a time, the ink cartridges went fast and are expensive to replace,and right now it has a chainsaw sound to it. and for the cost of the printer it isn't worth fixing and getting new ink.its done and now i must move on........"
50% Great 50% Yuck,"I purchased two for Christmas gifts, one for my mom, one for my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law loved hers. I preloaded it with family photos. The software was easy to use. The pictures looked surprisingly sharp for their size. She was thrilled when she opened it. My mom never received hers. I preloaded it as well but the screen was dim and all the charging in the world would not make it work correctly. There was no trouble-shooting info that could help correct the problem. I was very disappointed! If you are lucky enough to purchase one that works correctly - no worries! But, if the odds are truly 50/50, I'd look elsewhere."
DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!,I have so far thought that the Friday the 13th series has been alright. But this movie was terrible. It is absolutly unwatchable unless you are a huge fan. The movie takes place in space and Jason gets unthawed thats all the more proof you need not to see this movie. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and the acting is terrible. There are only two cool death scenes in the whole movie and thats it. DON'T see this movie.
Spacesex - a review from a Claude Challe convert,"Wow is all I can say! A great mix of music which gets your juices flowing (no pun intended!). Claude really gets the mood going & once you view the enclosed booklet which contains pictures of the rooms at the hotel on which the CD is based, you'll understand why the music has that soooo sensual feel packed with imagery. A great CD to listen to whilst laying back with your favourite person..make sure you have some candles & red wine handy as this music is bound to make some magic happen!"
Seriously?,"I've read fantasy books that make use of several fantasy cliches and still manage to be great. This is the mark of a great author; the ability to take something the reader may have seen several times before and make it interesting and exciting again.Goodkind takes just about every fantasy cliche, throws in his objectivist rants, and calls it a novel. Not a fantasy novel, that would be beneath him.Give me a break, Terry. The only thing original about this series is its complete lack of believable characters and dialogue.Don't waste your time."
Great...Stuff!,"I don't remember any band that sounds as good, as tight, as funky, as melodic as this one. Both guitarrists, Cornell Dupree and Eric Gale, have different and complementary styles. The bassist Gordon Edwards and the drummer Steve Gadd are one of the best duos of the 70's. And the late Richard Tee, genius of piano and organ, is the responsible for the harmonic and melodic inventions of this supergroup.This record worth every dollar."
Perfect!,"I got these goggles for my daughters to use during swimming lessons. They were having a hard time putting their faces in/heads under the water because it hurt their eyes, thus making it hard for them to learn what they needed to learn! These goggles are big, but they fit very nicely and the girls love them. The straps are easy to adjust and overall were very comfy. They didn't seem to fog up or leak, like so many other goggles."
Fletcher Point Driver Points,"Best Buy found for Fletcher Point Driver points. Perhaps because of the Thanksgiving holiday the order was a little slow in getting shipped - but then arrived in good time - once it was shipped. The points could not be found locally and we were out - with a job to finish, which aggravated our wait. Definitely would re-order again."
FREDDIE HUBBARD'S WORST ALBUM!,"I don't know what the recommendations are about since this is clearly Freddie Hubbard's weakest album. His playing is sloppy and the arrangements are run-of-the-mill jazz fusion songs with no soul or feeling: It sounds like this boring mish-mash was quickly put together in just one take haphazardly. If you want to hear his best album, which really puts this garbage to tremendous shame, then listen to his 1961 album ""Ready For Freddie."" Otherwise, don't waste your money on this trash."
"Great at first, but slows down over time until it's ineffective","In the first few weeks, I loved this shaver. However as it got older it shaved more slowly until it barely worked (=pulled hair painfully) after a few months. So, short term this is five stars but long term it's one."
Kaplan Kid Alert,"About 8 weeks ago I ordered the Kid Alert ""slow down"" figure from Kaplan. It arrived missing all the decals. Immediately I called to report the problem but couldn't make contact with a human being. After many emails and phone calls to their automated system on March 9 Crystal from Kaplan called me. Crystal told me I would have to deal with another company ""Step 2"" who actually makes the Kid Alert. After some discussion Crystal agreed to send me another Kid Alert to replace the incomplete one. The second Kid Alert arrived by Fed Ex today complete with all its parts. Thank you Crystal at Kaplan. I was required to rate this toy. First of all, it isn't a toy and second of all I just received it and haven't used it yet so the reviews I had to post aren't at all an accuate reflection of the item."
Disappointing!,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday from his grandparents. He was delighted for all the obvious reasons - it's a fun, rideable gigantic Thomas that plays all the fun songs. He ignored all other gifts for this one.However, I agree with everyone else's review...the black handle is absolutely ineffective. My husband even tried glueing it to make it work...it now lies on the floor in a corner of our dining room. The red handle is also very poor quality...turns in it's hole and comes out entirely. My son likes this, but I know it's not supposed to work that way. Lastly, the fun buttons that played the cute music have stopped working one by one. I haven't totally minded this, but it's been disappointing.If you're looking for a push toy, go elsewhere! I had no idea this toy was so expensive, and sincerely hope my mother in law paid less for such a poor quality item."
Incredible,This music (?) is way ahead of its time. Spaced-out surreal ambience makes you feel like you're on another planet. And you thought techno couldnt be relaxing...
American Crap,"It's tasteless, highly unimaginative, and boring in content, just like the singer(so she calls herself one). Now that's stretching the truth. Madonna couldn't sing if her life depended upon it. She is dull, and grossly overrated. Please go away Madonna...Enough is enough."
Probably my least favorite of the series,I didn't like the character when he was a supporting one in the other books and I like him even less here. Whiney spoiled little brat with way too much drama.The other thing that bugs is this reads like gay fiction. Rice has always brought a great deal of androgyny to her characters but this one is way over the top with it's man/boy love theme throughout.
Mmmm!,I think this is still his best! He does Roy Orbison better than Roy does! Really sexy Roy sound! ; )
not fully satisfied,"I am not sure if this is an older version, but the DVD were not as 'crystal clear' as another version (which was not HD)that I viewed on my TV.I do not think that this was a bootleg copy but I am not fully satisfied with the product.The shipping was very fast."
Not useful at all,"I received the item very quickly, but when I installed it, I became very un-happy with the product. First, there was a lot of ""extra"" software included on the installation disc that I did not want. The mouse caused the cursor to jump all over the screen and flutter, the number pad is useless for Excel. It only enters numbers and has no navigation options. The paste to clipboard did not work. The calculator was VERY VERY basic. Not at all what I needed or expected."
These are horrid,I received waffle-weave dish towels that I actually threw away. The hassle of returning them was too much so I chucked them because they were such horrible quality!
It broke straight away,"The material tore away from the rubber on day 2. Not a great product at all, the quality is very poor."
Fast forward review,"I was late getting to this film because I figured it would be lamo, but lo and behold they actually made a sleaze flick out of it, something rare in these Janet sunburst boob back to morality days.Anyway, we got several rambunctious Ted scenes clobbering screaming babes with tire irons and hunks of wood, lots of blood, and surprisingly a lot of nudity, even chasing around partially clad babes through the woods, something missing from the screen since the days of House on the Left, eh?Unfortunately, we also got several scenes marred by closeups of the straining Ted's face as he's humping, always objectional even in a porno loop, and several instances of flashing from nude babes to long ago dead nude babes, which edges the flick out of the sleaze category and into gore.So, 2 stars for the good parts, and an extra star just for daring to make something this nasty these days."
"A heart-wrenching, FABULOUS story for a first time author","As the sister of a female police officer and the Mother of a 7-year old son, this story tugged at my heart as well as making me swell with pride and compassion for all police officers dealing with gang members. Sherrie Board couldn't have done a better job authoring this sad but true story of the struggle(s) our probation and police officers face on a day-to-day basis. I highly recommend this good book to anyone who likes a good mystery read."
Does not live upto the expectations,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here. I expected in depth analysis of each strengths and possibly tips on how to build up on to those strengths and all I got was a short descrition of top 5 strengths and nothing more. Most of the book is about the theory that using one's strengths is better than overcoming one's weaknesses. The book had been much better if only a chapter or two were devoted to it and rest were left for an in-depth analysis of those strengths. If you can get hold of the code off the jacket of the book and take the test online, then the book is worthless."
Pretty good,"The game itself is relatively simple but fun to play.I'll admit that it took me a while to get used to it and that's because the game is set in World war 2 and I'm used to more modern weapons instead of just simple handguns and the like. But once you get used to the game, you hardly notice the primitive armaments anymore."
An absolute bore,"I was extremely disapointed in this movie. It was soooooooo boring. It started off with a battle. Then it dragged on and on and ended in a battle. Plus, the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen."

"Pre ""High-Tech"" Recording Quality","I would rate this 2 stars as the visual/video component is very weak and looks ancient (30 years old) when compared to dvd's with today's technology. This is heavy duty hard rock with some classics like Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll and Whole Lotta Love. Unfortunately, with recordings 30 years old, they did not have the benefit of today's high technology which makes it not as visually interesting as the five star dvd's (like Rolling Stones, Cher Farewell Tour, Eagles, Beatles Anthology, Fleetwood Mac, U2)."
Homedics Therapy Pillow,"Out of the box, the pillow seems like it would form easily around your head. Unfortunately, that was not the case. You need to work at forming the pillow to a comfortable position.I have neck and back problems and have used the one that is made of the stuff they claim was used in space. That one is much more comfortable. Maybe in time the the HoMedics pillow will soften up?"
"The album ""Truth"" was a major disappointment","The only song I had heard from this album was ""If I could"" which I immediatly loved. So I gambled and bought the entire CD-- and it wasn't cheap. Besides ""If I Could"" there is not a single other song I like, and I doubt this will even grow on me. Buying the single is worth it-- not the enture CD. The lyrics are so bland and at least when the Backstreet Boys sing songs where the chorus is repeated over and over it sounds good. Joee has the great looks, but needs some work on his songs. He definitly has potential."
Not True 1080p HD. Get the DVD.,"This is a great movie, very underrated in my opinion. However, I bought this blu ray and expected crisp 1080p picture quality. However, there are some grainy moments in the quality of the picture. It looked as if I was using an older dvd player with the three A/V components. There are also some strange dark blue streaks in the picture here and there. The disappointing thing is that this there was never any ""Wow"" Hd 1080p moments. The movie takes place in a lush jungle and you would think that there would be some great photography and HD moments. None comes to my head. If you really want to buy this movie, get the dvd. The blu ray is a disappointment."
Boring,I was very disappointed with this purchase. The film is rather dull and more toward the opposite of provocative. I would not recommend this video nor any of its subsidiaries.
"Married with Children, Funny Funny Funny! Packaging Sucks.","I received The complete series of Married with Children on Sept 27th. This is a great show, extremely funny. The only problem is that the packaging sucks. Sixteen Disks on two spirals. Only one sheet of paper with every episode in very small print that you peel off of the back of the box, but I got the entrie series for $35.00 on a pre-order sale, so even though I don't like the packaging it was well worth this bargain of a price. So many episodes I'll never get around to watching them all. I highly recommend this purchase. I did give it four stars instead of five because of the packageing, but considering your getting it for less than $5.00 a season, its a great deal."
Not worth the money,I got this stroller as a gift along with the baby trend sit and stand. When I put them both together it was clear which one was the better stroller. The Joovy leaves very little room for the toddler to sit once the car seat is in place. However the sit and stand has plenty of room along with cup holders for the parent and child as the child gets older. Even the person at babies r us said he returned is because of the same problem. I live in the city and need something that isn't as big as a double stroller.
All the songs are great!,"I love this cd. All the songs are so good. This is a first for me that when I purchase a cd, I love all the songs on it.I hope they'll have a new one soon. I had this album in the early 80's, and loved it. During my moving around, I misplaced it. I was so happy to see I can get one still. I LOVE IT !!!!!!"
Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection,"My order came faster than expected and that was nice. However, after viewing several of the dvd's, there are skips in some of them. This was disappointing because they were advertised as good as new. I don't think I would order from this person again."
good socks,they fit and they arrived on time. i would definately buy them again. thank you very much for the socks.
"Mostly Good, But Barely","There have already been some excellent and extensive reviews, so I have little to add. Although this tool is solidly constructed, I find it too bulky to carry, yet not bulky enough to alow the screwdrivers to be easily pried out. The saw is rather useless (another blade should be included), and while the scissors seemed strong, the weld holding the spring to the blade broke without extensive or intensive use. I consider these major flaws and would not recommend purchase--unless the price falls below $20."
Didn't take it yet...,"I was receiving some newsletters about the benefit of taking this product, so I just ordered it... Looking forward to post an update."
"Great, if only it lasted more than 2 years!","While it lasted, it worked great. The Atomic timekeeping, solar was fantastic, and the watch itself quite rugged. Unfortunately, after slightly more than 2 years (was a birthday gift June 2006), it started acting up. First, the auto-light sensor stopped working. The LCD portion has lost one segment, so it is very hard to read. Then, more seriously, the watch's atomic receptor stopped working, failing every time I try to get a new sync. Worse yet, it now resets itself to 1/1/2000 every night. The whole reason I bought this was to have it last for a long time. It is out of warranty, and I'm not about to throw good money after bad, especially after reading about other people's bad service experiences."
Its good but that about it,"The only reason I got this CD was because it was recorded in Moscow, my home town. The double Cd has a few tracks that I enjoyed but for the most part it was a very blah CD for me. I have seen Deep Dish live and enjoyed their music, but this Cd just didn't do it for me."
Table tennes Bag,It really fit and protec you paddle perfectly with space for two paddles and a front outside space to carry at least a dozen of balls very good finish and quality of details
Battle Boring,"I have always been a fan of techno/military novels from The Cruel Sea to Kilo Class, but this one just left me cold. I've read a couple of books by this author and found some of the early ones quite entertaining. Things have gone downhill. Each successive book is a flawed clone of its predecessor, and this one reached new lows in character development and plot. I got half way through the book and found I didn't like a single character in it and didn't care about the outcome. This is the first book that I have not wanted to read to completion in about 5 years"
Pleased with my purchase,"I've owned mine for two years and it serves the best tasting cup of coffee I've ever had at home. The only negative would be water loss. Frequently, I'll pour 10 cups of water in the machine and it only makes 8-9 cups. I've learned to compensate for this, so it's not an issue any longer. I would recommend to anyone."
Street numbers backwards!,"I only used maps one time. While in Gatlinburg, TN, I used my Etrex (loaded with MetroGuide). On the map of the street where my motel was located, the street numbers were backwards. The blocks were in the right order, but a store that I was looking for was located at the wrong end of the block! Guess that's one for the updates!"
Drawers won't close.,"I'm giving this two stars instead of one because after ten years, these carts are still useable, sort of. We bought them to store our son's Legos and K'Nex. They worked fine for that purpose, and he liked that he could roll them around to where he was building something. When he outgrew his toys, I ""borrowed"" these units to store craft supplies, because they fit neatly beneath the lowest shelf in my craft closet. I did not store heavy items in them, but discovered that after opening the lower drawers, you can't get them to close again without pulling out the unit and physically lifting the drawer back onto its little seat. This is inconvenient and is some kind of design flaw. I have replaced them with new, narrower drawer units which work much better and hold a lot more stuff more efficiently -- just a better solution for me."
Not exactly what I expected....,"This book could have been better if the author had given more depth to the characters... If the book was a bit longer I think it could have been a great one.... However, it is too short and does not allow the characters to blossom..."
Christ Lives in this book and in the heart of Believers,"This book is amazing for the believers that want to grow with Jesus Chrst there Savior It adds to your Study of The Word of God( the Bible) Basic instructions Before Leaving Earth anyways if you wanna grow remember that you get to do these things like reading a proverb a day or a book like this and don't forget you get to go to church to fellowship, worship and hear the Word of God spoken for all people Thanks Tepreene"
"Great idea, but you can get it cheaper","A swivel head for the faucet like this is a great idea if you don't have a separate sprayer nozzle on your sink but you want to be able to spray the water around. I have one and I use it to rinse out bowls, rinse out the sink itself, etc. But this particular seen-on-TV model is a bit expensive. The one I have is theDanco 88270 360-Degree Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Plastic, Chrome/Whitewhich goes for half as much and works fine."
not for me,I only read a few chapters of this book because the language was too graphic and very offensive. Not a book for me.
very rude,In my feedback i simply stated that the item i order was a bit pricey which it was however i still purchased the item cause i thought it was worth it well after posting my feedback i got a very rude email from the seller in which point he said not to buy from him again so if you like rude sellers then i guess this is the guy to buy from but personally im a nice person And i would expect the same after all i did buy from them thanks
2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If your idea of a enjoyable movie is 100 minutes of hanging out with the Beatles, by all means watch this movie, but if you want a little bit more than a glorified home video whose idea of characterization is assigning each Beatle a single trait, watch something else."
Love it,"I love Corelle. It can be slightly abused without a problem. After years of ceramic plates that, if accidentally brushed against another, chipped, Corelle is a welcome sign. It is microwave and oven safe, though be careful: in the past I left a plate in the microwave after it was done cooking for about 30 seconds. The plate EXPLODED into thousands of little pieces all over the inside of the microwave. I had owned that plate for two years. I contacted Corelle just to ask them if that was a typical problem and no questions asked they sent me a new one. GREAT customer service."
I like this book.,"It gives specific information for a beginner about how to sing. It has some simple diagrams/pictures in black and white that help you see what is going on when you sing. It has a chapter about how to start sight singing. It explains what to expect when you inhale/exhale where a beginner can understand it. I think it is a good book for beginners. If you do not know anything about how to actually sing, this book is pretty good."
Almost 5 stars...,"... but the mounting screws that come with this are an absolute joke. I don't know anyone foolish enough to trust a treasured musical instrument to the puny screws that are supplied with this hanger.Anyway, once you've got it mounted securely with the fastener of your choice you'll be very happy with it. Now I don't have to worry about drunken friends bumping my guitars off the wall. I've already purchased 3 and will be buying more soon."
Very funny,Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson have perfect chemistry together.It is one of the funniest flicks I've watched in a long time.
Garden of Lies,I absolutely loved this book and I recommend it to anyone who likes to read a long novel. The storyline was in detail and kept me interested. I will definitely read the sequel.
Cher's Best I don't think so,"This album is very disappointing, most of the songs are so far from Cher's best. I would be embarrassed to call it my best. Seems like a cheap way for a record company to make a buck. But then again I've yet to enjoy any 20th Century Masters Collection. Its as if these are Public Domain Songs. Sorry Cher, 1 Star"
"Pretty good, but needs a little work","It is an excellent game but it needs work. I personally think it is way too easy, but it's still fun. I couldn't give it a 5 star rating because it wasn't exciting enough, and I love exciting games. But, it was an overall good game if you like racing games and action. Don't waste your time... buy it! ~ Snoweater11, Weymouth MA"
Waste of reading! Don't lose your money!,"Book was BORING. I wish I could say different after reading. However, IT WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN AND LOSS."
Disappointing,"This toy was diappointing. At first it did not hold my grandson's interest. When he got older and seemed interested in it, it no longer worked."
"A comedy of errors in Carribean time, mon!","After traveling the Carribean, yourealize those folks march to a differentbeat. Time is not very important in theland of sun and azure seas unless youare a transported New Yorker trying tobuy and run a broken down hotel on asmall tourist resort island. A mustread if you have ever dreamed ofshucking it all and moving to the islandsto live ""happily ever after!"""
Goldberg is right on!,"This book was informative reading and the author's criticism of the mainstream media was presented logically, factually, and with a minimal amount of unwarranted emotion. Regardless of your political persuasion, after reading BIAS (if you are honest with yourself) you will agree with the author that our major networks need to take a closer look at fairness in reporting the news - for the sake of every U.S. citizen's best interests."
pretty good,It's ok . not great but not bad . good vibrations but just something about the shape that's not for me .
Cute Product,"We bought this lamp when our original lamp with a night light died. It matched the room colors and since my son loved Mickey, it was an easy sell. While it worked, it was great. But it lasted less than a year before the lamp went out entirely. If you buy it, buy it for the decor and not function."
good color fun,"its good, but if you like to save your video games this system isnt for you.it has a good handfull of video of games, and loads of accessories. their wasnt many rpg games for it, but their were tone of casual games like bonkers, and bust a move. since it takes 6 aaa batteries getting a charger is a good idea.theirs also a sega master system adapter allowing you to play sega master system games, the game gear can also play imported games."
I turned it off because of my kid,"What every other one star said. Heavy racial stereotypes. My husband is a regionally well known, published historian, and he did not find anything redeeming from an historical perspective.They are pretty old animation sequences, but I don't have a problem with the ""quality"" per se of the animation as a general viewer. But there is no way my child is watching these for entertainment and we are calling it a teaching moment when my alternative is to turn it off and teach her that is the appropriate response. Its free on Netflix, BTW. I would have been pretty upset if we had paid to rent it.Remember uncle Remus? That kind of thing. Disney put that in the vault and won't let it out for a good reason. Romanticizing derogatory stereotypes or feeling nostalgic about entertainment with racist overtones is inappropriate. But if you must, please do not indelibly etch these images into your child's consciousness."
Chris,"Its just not worth it, the guns are terrible the game is bad. It takes too much to run. I have a geforce4 TI 4400 and its a little laggy at medium graphics. I think Infogrames shot themselves in the foot with this one. Stick to the older unreal, it holds up much better. Save your money buy something else."
Very enjoyable...,"Loved the Kegelstatt, liked the others...it's hard to go wrong with Mozart chamber music...and Barenboim is a master...especially some of the piano concertos..."
Boring and unfunny episode,"I am a huge fan of the first three seasons. But this season opener is pathetic. This episode attempts to replace raw, edgy humor with about 9 billion cameos from football players and coaches. If I wanted to see football players, I'd watch football. When I watch The League, I want it to be funny."
Too narrow,"I ordered this shoe directly from the Easy Spirit site. I ordered a medium width, and that is the marking the shoe is showing, but it is much too narrow for my foot, making it very uncomfortable. I made the mistake of not returning them, thinking that I could wear them and stretch them out: That didn't work. Guess I'll spend the money to take them to a shoe-shop to have them professionally stretched."
I love the dogs but what's Holly's deal?,"I have read every one of Susan Conant's books in the last two weeks, so maybe that's why I am so disappointed with her latest effort. Rowdy and Kimi are as intelligent and beautiful as ever but what happened to Holly? I understand that she's had head trauma but what's with the bitterance she seems to be displaying? I miss her old dog absorbed happy self. I also miss the old Steve. That whole Steve storyline just isn't believable, it's too farfetched for his in control character. I found myself wanting to reread her first book so I could remember the good times."
Refurbished Fujifilm Finepix Camera,"I recently purchased this camera and the guy had told me everything would be brand new. When i received the product the looks of the camera was good but it does not function properly at all, it was a waste of money and i really wish to get it replace. i complained about it but i haven't gotten an answer from the guy ever since i first spoke to him. the quality of it looking brand new is great but the camera does not function the way it is suppose to. its not worth it."
Where's the talent?,"I think Jennifer Lopez is famous for all the wrong reasons. She isn't the greatest singer in the world and if her video is supposed to be a reflection of herself then it seems like she's a little self-centered. Her vocals are disappointing especially in ""If you had my love"". I admire all the people who managed to extract something good from these musical monstrosities. I however could not force myself to find anything good in any of her songs. Sorry Jen but this is my honest opinion."
a mediocre tale that doesn't live up to it's true potential.,"This was a quick read for me, but it just didn't leave me thinking afterwards. It is a great concept, immortals living among us, but I think that the author could have done a lot more with it."
TO OLD,"This CD is old and the ""flashcards"" it says it has are not really flashcards, they are just questions on the computer.It may add on to a study plan however."
OK,"Didnt smell like coconut. VERY VERY messy, it kept leaking over everything when it melted. It wasnt as mosturizing as i expected it to be either."
Better Than I Anticipated,"When I saw, ""Letters To God"" being advertised, I had no desire to watch it. I don't know why, really. But for some reason it just did not appeal to me. But it did appeal to my 16 year old daughter so tonight we watched it on Netflix instant stream and all I can say is...""Pleasantly Surprised"".I expected it to be over-the-top acting, as most Christian films I've seen are, but aside from the constant talk about God, religion, heaven, and spirituality, it wasn't one of those hokie ""Christian"" films at all. It, in fact, was rather well done.I rented this video to review."
"More ""Collector"" value than ""Entertainment"" value...","This is great to finally have the Simpsons on DVD. Personally... I'm really excited about seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5. In this Season 1 set, the episodes don't yet have the fully developed peripheral characters (i.e. Wiggum, Burns, Comic Book Guy, etc) that makes the show TRULY great. But it's still fun to see how the characters developed in the beginning.If it isn't obvious already... I plan on buying each season's DVD set.The commentary on this one is also worth the price of admission.Enjoy!"
Waiting for the extended edition,"LOTR is a great movie, but I see no point in buying this short edition of it while I already own the extended edition on DVD. Only the release of the extended edition on Blu-ray will make me spend money once more."
Listening to Turkish,"I didn't have time to use this tool very much before our trip. I listened to the tape as I was doing other things but never got the chance to actually use both the book and tape to its best advantage. However, I made a Turkish friend in Istanbul and may get an opportunity to go back some day. I hope to use this book to be able to talk with my friend in her native language half as well as she spoke English."
Good product,"I make a lot of my own greeting cards and I always had the problem of not being able to print to the edge. Now the problem is solved. It also helps when your greeting card program is not quite compatible with your printer. You can print over onto the perforations a little and still have a perfect card.I have only two minor complaints.1. The card stock is not quite as heavy I would prefer, especially if using a lot of photos. Still, if you play with your printer settings a little you can do quite well.2. It is a little difficult to see and tear the card at the perforations. After tearing, there were a lot of jagged edges which you had to smooth.Overall, it is a great product and the results are worth the minor difficulties."
Be warned - not for busty ladies.,"The bag looks great. It's a sharp design and color, but if you have a curvy figure, this bag is extremely silly...basically excentuating your...top curves.Bet it looks very sporty and stylish on boys or the flat chested."
Weak effort,"All in all, I was disappointed with Timeline. The writing is fair, the technology is not explained to pull you in. There is a bit of humor in this one which I did enjoy. I do think it is a formula book from a writer who had given up trying to create something great. It is a shame because Jurassic Park and other Crichton books have that spark. Sure it's a fast read - but not entirely satisfying."
Helpful but general,"This book is a GREAT resource for those who are new to the audtioning process, or have not had a lot of classes that prepare one for audtions. It gives some great basic tips--things every actor should know before going out on an audtion. Most of it seemed like information that should be a no-brainer to most actors. There was a great section on breathing--I would recomend that to anyone!"
Fun but could use some work,I actually enjoy this game but I admit it could use some work. There should be more themes to play and just a better quality over all. It is a great laugh and it's amusing until you beat everything! It's not expensive so if you are bored and want a few laughs I reccomend it.
The most incomplete engineering book ever.,It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much. Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance. This book does not teach good engineering practices.
Great Book,Enjoyed this book. Great mystery/suspense with the right level of romance. Great ending. Anita .... keep them comming!!!
Fabulous!!!!!!!,"This book was fantastic!! I loved it!! Of course, I love all Animorph books!! It was weird, crazy, and insane all at once!! KA Applegate is the best author ever! She did a fantastic(times 100000000000000000 more)Buy this book! Or the Yeerks shall get you."
I Love Lucy and Desi,"I am a real fan of Lucy and Desi from the 50's, so this DVD is really interesting to see."
Best PDA on the market.,"I have tried many PDA`s, but this one gives the best value and quality for the price."
High Impact!,"I really enjoyed working out to this video, although it was a bit too high impact for me. The jumproping sections are very difficult. I do not reccommed this video if anyone lives below you because you spend most of the time jumping! It is a great workout---but be prepared for the intensity level."
The Rest of the Story - Paul Harvey,The book is all here and still bound together. The pages are quite yellow from age. But I am grateful to have it. Thanks
Solid Backup Drill,"I purchased the Hitachi 12Volt drill after my Dewalt 9.6V bit the dust. The latter was old, awkward and had a broken chuck collar so I was happy to see it go. The Hitachi is light and has reasonable toque. It is well balanced and stable standing on its battery pack. I use it in tandem with my Panasonic 12V, probably the best rechargeable drill I've ever purchased. The Hitachi gets the basics done and I have no complaints after 1 month of use."
HARMFUL TO WOMEN,"I read this book years ago and I was absolutely appalled and insulted. She treats women like they are absolute idiots! If you are open minded this book is NOT for you, if you are easily swayed then good luck... you may become one of Dr. Laura Schlessinger's drones."
A delightful read,"Just finished this wonderful book. It's amazingly funny, warm, intersting and also unbelievable but thats what gives it its charm. Wonderfully written, Fantastic Characters and an interesting mystery. Odd is a bit like odd thomas (steven Koontz) wonder who came first? Ir you are looking for a very funny and light mystery and one with warm paranormal overtones , this book is for you. So glad I found it.Lisa"
It came in 6 different sections rather than 10,"Friends is a must have for those who enjoyed watching friends.. I love it.. the only this is I wish it was packaged severally according to Season rather than combing seasons together. It comes in 6 different sections rather than 10, as i expected it would be. Other than if you love Friends it's a must have!!"
broken tablets,"This product hasn't seemed to promote melt on the roof yet. Half of the bucket contained broken tablets, and there is ground particles that I am unable to throw up on the roof."
Donell............,"Okay I love Donell but this album could not touch his second, which was a classic. I mean, it was a good effort but he can do much better. I'm waiting for his 3rd effort which should drop some time soon. Overall, though, you should add this to your collection, especially if you're a big Donell fan."
International Version Textbook,"This international version textbook was half the price of the US version, while the seller claimed that ""everything"" was the same as US version, I found that the question sections at the end of each chapter had different questions than the US version. All the chapter text was the same but the review questions were different. Assignments came back a bit different as half of my class had the international version of this text. It was a pain to try and get the actual assignment questions from someone in the class with the US version text. But hey, I saved money in the end!"
Don't waste your money!,"Everything relavant to marketing can be learned in the left inside flap of the jacket, unless of course you are looking for a book on the science of building a fire. The author has no experience, he only uses 2 real world examples that he knows very little about, and nothing in this book is relavant to marketing. I want my money back."
Good product.,This is a very nice product and it makes your skin really soft. I would recommend it to somebody else.
S710a Returned,"I've been waiting a while for this phone and just got it yesterday. Most everything is the same (except for the design)as the 610. The menu is almost identical. With the exception of an MP3 player and better camera that's really it.The reason I am returning mine is because I planned on using the phone as an MP3 player. Unfortunately, the phone can ONLY use memory stick Duo (not PRO) which has a max of 128 megs. What the? Do a search for yourself and see that even Lexar and Sandisk only go to 128 for the plain memory DUO stick. What a bummer! Including a few photos brought over from my PC and 5-6 songs I filled the 32 meg card that was included. Oh well. Hope this helps.Sony Ericsson consumer support had no idea why the phone doesn't use the newer version of the memory stick DUO. Even the new PSP from Sony will use the memory stick duo pro which opens up a whole other can or worms!"
cute book,I read tomorrows wizard when I was in 3rd grade and loved it. This book basicaly involves the training of a youg wizard by tomorrows wizard. I found this book very amusing and should be read by the light at heart. Allthough this book isn't exactly a replacement for Harry Potter or the circle of magic it is certinly and wonderful book.
Great Loppers,"My old loppers were about 15 years old and had been sharpened repeatedly, but when the handle finally started falling apart it was time for a new one. These Fiskar's loppers are wonderful! The PowerGear makes it easy to cut branches up to 1.5"" or 2"" (depending on the type of wood). I didn't find that I had to open the handles any wider than on other loppers, so that isn't an issue to me.I have a lot of landscaping and these loppers make it much easier for an early-50's woman like myself to keep my yard neat and trim."
Read it on the plane,Great easy read for a plane ride or a short trip. This is a good companion to his other books on management.
THIS BOOK IS A DISGRACE TO PHYSICS.,"We used Jackson's ""classic"" in the graduate E&M class. But Jackson doesn't teach. I wound up learning the material from the instructor's handouts and help in office hours.Jackson's book falls below the threshold of being a true textbook. The book does not educate. There are zero worked examples, only bombastic dreck. The sooner this book is replaced by something user-friendly, the better."
Good to Government Cheese,"Good to Government Cheese. Well, the jury is no longer out. What was thought to have worked 20 or 30 years ago may not be all it was cracked up to be. ""The bus"" analogy appears to have been a recipe for creating a completely narcissistic, homogenous company lacking the ability to see outside of their own contrived success. Can you say Logan's Run? Collins offers plenty of good advice however; I think we can all agree that the ""BEST"" people do not always create the best company. Simply throwing people off the bus is not necessarily change for the better."
Poorly Written,"Being a fan of John Burchett's crime novels with their Thai setting, this really pales by comparison. It's poorly written and plodding, really lacking in good narrative skill. The protagonist isn't a well-developed character and the story doesn't engage. So many books, so little time, so don't bother with this one."
I'm a self-imposed ZANE fan...,"...and I LOVE her work. But I'm sorry this book sucked to the high heavens. I'm going to keep it REAL...the character development in this book was WEAK, very weak. And the storyline...well let me just say Zane did a MUCH better job with the short story of the same title in Sex Chronicles.Yet another book to be used in my fireplace..."
"A little late in the ""Beat Rush""","I would have given this video another star if it would have been one of the first works on the beats I had seen. But, there are more videos on the beats than any other group of writers with the possible exception of expatriate writers in France of the 30's! The value of this video is found in the interviews. The beat writers are great storytellers on and off the page, and it is a joy to see them in action. If this is your first video on the beats I recommend those by Mystic Video also available at Amazon."
The Happening,"The Happening really fools you into believing this movie will be great. From the beginning to the end, this movie fails to deliver. There are some things in nature that we will never understand/comprehend. This movie has no real answers, no real twists and was overall unbelievable which is not much fun."
Not The Same Quality as Target,"We bought this couch because it was cheaper than what was advertised in the Target magezine. As is the case most times, you get what you pay for. Not the greatest quality"
Carole King - Simple Things,"'Simple Things' is a really nice and hard to find album. It's pleasant but not so good as her famous ""Tapestry"". I like the songs ""To Know That I Love You"", ""In the Name of Love"" and, of course, ""Hard Rock Cafe""."
Does the trick,"I bought the glider and ottoman set mainly because it can be shipped to Hawaii for free and it was the least expensive glider I could find. It's not as fancy as some of the other gliders out there, buts its definitely nice. It was shipped to us just fine via FedEx or UPS, I can't remember. It only took a few days to get to us.If you are looking for no thrills and simple design, this is a great glider."
Don't buy this router under,"Even with firmware v1.03.3 and after changed the configuration many times, my WRT300N performs worse than my old wrt54g. It performs worse on coverage and velocity."
NOT VERY HAPPY,THE ITEM WAS NOT DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE COST OF SHIPPING WAS NOT AS STATED. THE ITEM WAS DAMAGED INTRANSIT OR DAMAGED PRIOR TO SHIPPING.
Finally!,"After receiving the first one, which was obviously used, I returned it. It took a very long time to finally get the replacement, but the product itself is great for my lunch. It's a little difficult to separate the two pieces, hopefully that will get better with a little use."
What a Treat!,"I'm amazed that I'm the first to write a review of ""Habit"", by William James. Many of the James editions are actually so inexpensive, I consider them ""Thank You's' from Kindle for just being a subscriber. I write this review for having learned so much about mental habits, how they influence our lives for better or worse, how they originate and how to go about altering bad habits, and how to develop better ones. O.k., so the title tells you this already, but you can have the audio on Kindle recite it to you as you walk your dog. Don't yet have a dog? You can still always get one! You can call him 'William' or ' James' and walk him as you listen to this fine book."
Didn't do anything,"I bought this item to connect a microphone to my MacBook. It supposedly has line and microphone settings. I got no amplification of the microphone at all on the mic setting. It was just like plugging the mic directly into the computer. Next I bought an ArtTube preamp, which worked for one day and started crackling. Finally I bought a Blue Yeti mic, which works great."
The failures and oceans of blood caused by Communism.,"Pipes does a bang up job of placing Communism as a brutal system. As a conservative myself, I find his analysis not always fair. Pipes makes the comparison that Lenin was worse than Stalin, and his primary motives were revenge when he first revolted against the Tsarist system. I think some historians would find some fault with this analysis. I believe Lenin was less brutal than Stalin. Also his comments about the overthrow of Allende suggest that the Armed Forces coup de etat was legitimate. WOW, that is certainly a stretch. His analysis on Castro and Mao were on target.This is a very readable summary of communism. I would just warn the reader that some of views of Professor Pipes are very conservative, and may not be credible to those who are interested in a even handed approach to history."
"Simple, Easy, Reliable Panasonic Cordless-Good Value","If you seek a very nice, simple to set up, easy to purchase and most of all very reliable cordless phone I can strongly recommend this one. It has more than enough features for 95% of everyone needing a cordless phone. Having four seperate headsets is very important for someone like me who is getting older. I have one in the bedroom, basement, kitchen and living room. The battery lasts seemingly forever; the reception is crystal clear and strong, and it has a classy design. The DECT format is brilliant and is better than any other cordless phone I have owned."
"Nice, but you're paying for the name; not warm enough","The sale price of around $100 should be the list price. The list price of $250 is seriously inflated. It's a nice jacket; the wool is soft and there is a quilted lining, but it's also thinner than expected and just not enough insulation. I bought this for my boyfriend who already has a peacoat but wanted another that would be warmer for New York City winters. This coat does not fit the bill. He is broad-shouldered and has a 46"" chest and 36"" waist, usually wears a Large or Extra Large. We ordered the Large and it fits fine everwhere except the shoulders where it's tight so he can't lift his arms up. The buttons are also kinda wimpy for a peacoat; his current army/navy-thrift-shop-bought-peacoat has larger, better secured buttons. If you live someplace where winters don't get super cold (or if you're in the car a lot), this coat should be fine. Make sure to get the buttons reinforced and don't pay more than the sale price."
A singularly dull read,"_Yellow Fever, Black Goddess: The Coevolution of People and Plagues_ could have been a penetrating examination of the relationship between humanity and disease. Christopher Willis certainly had fertile ground to work, but the book ends up being a dull and pedantic trudge that fails to bring the best of the academic or the popular to the reader.The text wanders through evolutionary biology and human history without any real sense of direction. The biographies and personal histories read like indifferent `human interest' stories injected into an otherwise uninteresting science news broadcast."
Mindbending,"Wow, what can I say. Definitely a movie my girlfriend and I will be watching over and over. Very gripping, tense, and complex. Still trying to figure out some of it. I can't wait to watch it again, this time with the commentary track."
it says 250000 feet,The machine doesnt have long distance. I go little far away from the machine and my connection speed drops down. I didnt like it..
did nothing for my plantar fasciitis,"after reading the reviews on amazon, i decided to pick up 2 pairs for my horrible plantar fasciitis..wore them yesterday and all they did was squeak loudly in my closed shoes, and did nothing to alleviate my heel pain..however, i am happy to say that the ""foot rubz foot massage ball"" did a whole lot and makes up for the money i wasted on these..will try to return these as they are useless..."
Poorly designed,"If you want a trouble free set stay away from Samsung. These units have a color wheel, 3 fans and a 250 dollar lamp that need to be replaced periodically."
If only it were 400 pages shorter...,"Unique, clever, witty, richly detailed...TOO detailed. While the history of magic is important for the reader to truly grasp the world Clarke has created, her fantasic story gets lots in all the backstories, footnotes and slow-moving narrative. It wasn't until chapter 40-something that I actually started taking interest in the story and the characters. By chapter 50, I was riveted until the conclusion when the story unfortunately loses all momentum and ends with a whimper. Overall, the book would have been great, if only it were about 400 pages shorter!"
Broken Upon Arrival,Never tried item as the infuser was shattered upon arrival. What is going on Amazon?I can tell you that the handle is a little small as the mug was still in one piece. I prefer the Primula handle over the Bodum handle for sure.
A very good reference book for beginner and experience technician,"It started from the basic fundamental of fiber optics its uses, termination, safety, testing , documenting and upto its application"
EVERYBODY IS A CRITIC....,I do not have some fancy sound system and the DVD sounded just fine to me. I enjoyed it and if you are a true RUSH fan you will enjoy it too.
China strikes again,"recieved these cutters in good time and condition. Just in time, as my old set had had it after many years. Needed some 3/8"" plugs for a job I was doing, Cut two plugs out of 3/4"" hickory,that was it for this cutter as it was dull and burnt. These cutters are junk! The one star is for the case they came in."
Excellent book to develop the foundations of financial accounts,"I learn by example and this book allowed me to do just that. With the 39 well-explained real-life like transactions the authors guides the student through many aspects of financial transactions. A very good book and well worth the read to develop a solid foundation to financial accounting. Not a comprehensive financial accounting book by any means, but does an excellent job developing the most important concepts. The book also provides an introduction to ratio analysis which is useful especially after going through the case. In all, very highly recommended! Good job Mr. Ittelson!"
Frame Fit Pump!,"Another relatively hard to find item in this day and age. It works well. Provides good pressure. A little on the fragile side compared to my old Silca and Zefal pumps of the mid to late 70's. The finish scars easily and the gromet that fits over the presta valve, easily distorts, making it difficult to reinsert the dust plug. Other than that, it's fine."
Perfect bag for a guy!,I bought this for my nephew and he's loving it. The storage is great and the padding is protective without being too much.
Same old [stuff]....,"The cover of the book makes big promises, but as I expected, it is nothing but filler material. The synopsis of the book can be written in one sentence: Change identity, move overseas, hide money, and be careful. How? Buy yourself an ID or a passport. That was the most direct advice in the book. The rest is written in broad generalities and suppositions. In summary, this book is just plain useless."
I HATE IT,"Worst Link Park album I've ever heard, ever. Do not buy this CD if yo uare a fan of 'old school' Linkin Park."
"Smart French is a bit too ""Smart""","I certainly would not call this a beginning level CD. It starts right in with advanced level conversations, offering no information on vocabulary or verb conjugations. I've had seven years of French study, but I bought this ""beginning"" level to brush up on my French for an upcoming visit to Provence. The one helpful thing about this program is that it does show you what to listen for in native french speakers. I would definitely not recommend this CD to someone who is a BEGINNER."
worthless toy,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to use at her slumber party. What a waste. I had to do most of the assembly, and even then they did not turn out. The material was very poor quality and did not even cover the braclets. The glue was useless and would not stick. This was a huge disappointment to all of us."
Starts off good and then . . .,"it gets bad. Not just bad but monotonous. There is little variation in the game and as far as FPS and other shooters I have seen, this is a mess.Driving the cars is difficult. There are endless shootouts and running and running (did I mention running?) through long levels that just become so boring you could fall asleep. There is little variation in the levels, the lighting is bad and the sound is dismal.Sparks your ""operator"" is so whiney and can't act very well. Jada Pinket is hot and fun to play . . . the rest of it.There are glitches and the so called ""clues"" and ""fill-ins"" to the movie the Matrix Reloaded are so nominal (nothing you could have figured out yourself) that you don't really miss anything.I am surprised at the Warchoski Brothers. This game is so [crummy] and buggy and the story is so dull and disposable. You wont miss anything if you don't play this one. Not a thing."
The Notorious Career of Al Dunlap in the Era of Profit-At-Any-Price,"Al Dunlap -- a.k.a. ""Chainsaw Al"" -- was ruthless in downsizing corporations for short-term shareholder profit. While reviled on Main Street, Dunlap was loved on Wall Street for bringing huge returns to investors and shareholders ... until the dark side of his actions began to emerge."
Watch re-runs of Gilligan's island,"If you want to see Amanda Donohoe naked, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, it is rather boring and slow moving. Oliver Reed is totally miscast as the adventurer who advertises for a ""wife"" to spend a year on a desert island. The editing is choppy and sporadic and the direction looks as if the director was attempting to make a statement that he was keeping to himself."
Good but....,"This was definitely a bit too challenging for a 5 year old. My nephew is pretty good with directions but he needed a lot of help with this. It is however, a good price for an educational product. Pros - Good price, educational and challenging. Cons - Pieces were somewhat flimsy and didn't fit snug."
mala beads,The brown wooden mala beads are fading in color after only a couple of weeks. They are turning green.
Ok,This book is an ok book but wasn't my favorite book. If you like books about saving animals and mysteries this book is for you.
Theatrical ear for jazz? Inversations well constructed...,"Inversations just may be one of the best put together albums Ive heard in a long time on drums, piano, and bass, etc. Ive heard quite a few that dont mix it up and this one mixes it up quite well, often on some albums you get one mood or a couple and you wait for the album to kick it in the ass and go different directions the wait on this album short lived it seems as Ari knows how to put a puzzle together pretty well in his youth go along for his ride on Inversations and wear your seat belt gotta see him live..."
Why does the game always freeze up?,i have a very high end computer and this game just refused to play smooth. Dont you love it when youre on your horse and it freezes up every 5 seconds? Never had this problem with Oblivion. Save your money people unless you have a super fast million dollar computer!
Good but a little outdated.,"This book is nicely organized and well-written, but many people may be better served by online tutorials or a more modern book on their specific OS/distribution. I bought this because a course I'm taking requires us to ssh into the University's Linux server and program in the *nix environment. This book is great for learning your way around a free shell, the terminal of your favorite distro, or even cygwin. However if you are looking for a book to teach you to use a modern Linux distro, complete with GUI, this is probably not the book for you. And since much of this info is available on the net, I wouldn't recommend paying the list price."
Poor attempt to mix alternate history w/ views on religion,"Saw the good reviews.. Had high expectations. The author took what could have been a great topic, and overlaid it with a metaphysical view on reincarnation. As a story mechanism, it worked ... OK.. but in the end became over used.The story pacing is Veeeery slow. Unless you are a speed reader, you will bail on the story.If you like other authors of alternate history (Turtledove, Stirling, Flint, etc..) this book is NOT for you. Kim's topics are good, but the vignettes read like molasses."
From Back Cover,"I remember the day when my life began to spin out of control...Without going into too much detail, it was the day that a birthday cake, a very naughty gift, an incredible one-night stand and a ""cover curse"" at the magazine I work for all came together....Now I'm heading to Nowheresville, U.S.A., to man-sit Sam Long, the hunky veterinarian I slept with last night, all under the cover of a job assignment! How I'm supposed to maintain a professional distance at this point is totally beyond me! But my career (and his safety) depend upon it. Since I've never left New York City, I guess I should look at this as an adventure. I can only hope that while I'm out covering my job (and my boss's behind), someone will cover me. And if I play my cards right, that person might just be Sam...."
C++? I don't think so!,"The caption on the front of this book says: ""Provides a concise, comprehensive guide to the ways ADO 2.0 can be used in all kinds of applications. Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP.""I have no issue with the first sentence. The second sentence, however, is a blatant lie. I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves. There are a combined total of less than a page of things referencing C++ in here. If you're going to claim something, maybe you should make sure you actually deliver. This is pathetic.I, for one, am not planning on buying any more Wrox books in the future.Tom McKearney tmckearn@hotmail.com"
Good Product,Weed wacker was good but the battery that came with it sucked. One season for a $40.00 battery isn't getting it.
Quite possibly Darkest Hour's finest,"This, Darkest Hour's first release is a surprisingly super good listen, with all of Darkest Hour's finest qualities, speed, amazing solos, mellow acoustic moments, and great vocals. There is a little bit more breakdowns on this CD then Darkest Hour has on any of their others, and they fit really well into these songs. What amazes me most is how young Darkest Hour was when they made this and how good it is. I'd say that this and Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation are tied for Darkest Hour's best."
It sucks.,"This shredder sucks. It worked for a little while, then as soon as there's a paperjam it overheats, won't reverse, won't move or anything. I only put in 6 pages so I don't know what the big effing deal is. Now it's just a piece of junk, because to be able to unscrew the top off you need a special long, skinny screwdriver, which I obviously don't have at my office.So needless to say, don't bother, just invest more money on a better quality product."
This is a fictional edition!,"I'm a bit embarrassed. The book offered here has exactly the same subtitle as Jay Courtney Fikes' book titled ""Carlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties"" (It's set out on the Amazon pageCarlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties. Besides, the book IBSNs listed here are exactly the same as that of Fike's book! How this could be? As far as I know, Margaret Ranyan's book ""A Magical Journey With Carlos Castaneda"" has been published at least twice (in 1996 by Millenia Press and in 2001 by iUniverse) but in either case the book hasn't had the subtitle ""Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties"". I just wonder, has anybody ever seen the book offered here? Is this some ""special"" Ranyan's book edition I've never heard before or maybe this is just a mere mistake? Too bad that this book is ""unavailable"" now. Several days ago the seller HPB-072 offered it for about $50. Wow! The book must be a real rarity!"
DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"More than 50% of this book consisteng of 11 chapters, does not contain matrerial that Microsoft lists as objectives for writing the exam! The rest of the book (Chapers 7 to 11) has no down to earth technical material. The acompanying CD does not have any real-world test examples LIKE those that occurs in the test. (HOW CAN MICROSOFT PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS BOOK and promote it as a study guide for their tests??)Bottom line is, dont buy this book. You'll prepare yourself better by gettiong in a good night sleep the night before, than trying learn something.It doesnt even deserve one star!"
speaker muffled,"Overall, I like this product. The soft case slips on pretty easily and allows access to all of the buttons and ports- including the reset button on the back. The texture will keep the device securely in a pocket, but allows me to pull it out firly easily. It also stays in place pretty well on a desk while I use it. There is also a little cushioning in case I drop my Z22 or have it banging against my knee in a cargo pocket. The main downside I see is that it muffles the speaker more than I would like. Sometimes I end up missing my reminders because of that. I also can't figure out why it came in a package of 2 and has so many screen protectors in the case."
Not worth it,This book is a very basic book on bettas.I have been to certain betta websites on the internet that offer more information than this book does about these fish.. I do not think this is worth spending your money on i have read the book and there are still certain questions i have about bettas that it didn't answer.
Scared us to death,"My son is 2, 25 lbs, wore a small that was too tight. We took out 2 of the floating devices, btw they are just foam bars. They are meant to be removed as your child grows so we were using it properly. He jumped off the first step and sunk. We didn't wait to see if he would float back up. One mishap was enough to return it. Amazon was great about the return. Fast, easy and efficient."
Steal a Deal!!!,"Goodies: Awesome for the price , Shipping was quick, Easy to use, Big screen.Badies: Doesn't let you store regular files."
Great + important = watch,"This is a great film/documentary...Pros:-Informative and educating about today's issues...-Well-madeCons:-Children (the most crucial members of society, who should be watching this more than anyone) won't be able to watch it, because of the inclusion of a bafflingly unnecessary, long, drawn-out stripper scene, with full-nudity. (it's like actually going to a strip club, except you're watching a documentary). I was so disappointed, because I advocate showing these kinds of documentaries in schools (and at home)."
Photo Heavy,"This book is wonderful if you're a fan of Kahn's work. The book is unique in that the text is Kahn's original words. However, this book is not really a textbook - it functions more like a coffee table book. It has lots of photos and few words."
"Simple and effective, but pricey.","This sliding trash bin is quite simple to install and works like a charm, but does it really need to cost so much? There's no getting around the price, however, unless you can fabricate your own. The product itself is great though. I think it took me a grand total of ten minutes to open, read the instructions and install this product in my kitchen."
Pretty good,"This game is really fun!These are the only bad things:*Once you beat story mode and unlock all the characters,(it isn't easy), it gets sort of boring.*You can't die. every time your hearts go to 0, you fall apart and lose some studs, (the currency), they just go out and you can get them again.*once you unlock use old save (where you can load characters from the first game,but you have to have memory data), you can't be them in the cantina.(the place where you start out.)"
From a Rock and Roll Fuddy Duddy,"I bought one of these for a Christmas present for my brother and one for me. We're both connoiseurs of this music.When all was said and done, there is most certainly some good stuff here, and it's fairly representative of that era. But quite frankly, there are way too many 2nd and 3rd rate cuts included to make this set worth owning.I played mine so few times that I don't even know where it is any more. I'm especially sorry I gave one to my brother for Christmas. He deserved better."
Excellent Game Play,The game play on Mario World is one of the best of all time. Comparing graphics on a 16bit console with anything made now is pointless. It is all about game play. You can actually have fun playing this game and that is the whole point of playing video games.There are very few games out today that have the game play of these older SNES titles.
buena compilacion..aunque sabe a poco.....,"gran coleccion de canciones...ya se...faltan algunos temas..sobran algunos, pero pienso que es una obra muy recomendable sobretodo para los que se arriman por primera vez al trabajo de este sencillo pero interesante artista..."
"preposterous, but cool...","I first saw this cheesey B flick back in '69 or '70, back when movies like this were en vougue. Think about it. The CIA recruits a misfit group of Hells Angel types to rescue and return a US presidential advisor from behind enemy lines in Viet Nam. So, here come these booze drinking, pot smoking, verile heroes to the rescue. And what fun it is! Keep in mind, American GI's are not allowed to step foot where this hostage advisor is being held, but bikers are. They party hard before the battle, do lots of local women, retro-fit their choppers and off they go. What ensues is pure fictional hocum. Lots of slo-mo action with a cool 70's style score. A great nostalgic fix for fans of this genre.Don't worry about the intricasies of the plot and story-line here. Just sit back and enjoy. I did."
Necessary Foundational Information,"It is true. Not too many Americans are aware that the Founding Fathers called the Articles of Confederation of 1781 our, ""first Federal Consti-tution."" Mr. Jensen points out that they were the written expression of the political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence. If one understands the concept of local state sovereignty (or independence) as expressed in the Articles, then they will have a much better understanding of the argument between the Federal Government and the Confederate Government (1861-1865)which was only a continuation of the long argument over the nature of the Union of American States. (And, as one reviewer points out, it is an on going argument until this day.) All in all, it is an excellent read; and very pertinent information."
beware no bean bags,"I thought I was purchasing a bean bag game - as the title indicates - but I received 12 ping pong balls instead of bean bags. Beware - if you want a ""bean bag"" game - this isn't for you. Its also made of cardboard, which I guessed because of the price, however the stand is just two pieces of cardboard that are folded and held on with tape."
Feel good,This is a great feel good holiday movie. Nothing too heavy. Good soundtrack too. Makes you feel good after watching it.
Focus Focus Focus,not as bad as the title sounds...maybe 4 3/4 stars...trys to get you to focus on what is right and not what will continue to distract you...a guy gave me the book to read that used to throw clubs when he was unhappy...said it changed his whole approach to the game...i havent seen him throw a club in 6 months so i thought I'd try the book too.I never threw clubs and now I figured out why....same indian shoots all the arrows...why be mad at myself..?
boring,This movie did not go anywhere. It held my attention but never got to the point. I want my 2 hours back.
A good book,"This book chronicles Claire's feelings as she is divorced by her husband. She came to terms with herself, her new baby and their perdicament. She even manages to find a betterside of herself and happiness as she embraces the challanges life has hoisted upon her. A good book, a light read and something you won't want to put down."
Different medicine perspective,"Admittedly, I had just finished ""Hot Lights, Cold Steel"" which has turned out to be one of my all time favorites, when I picked up this book. I had heard good things and I was not disappointed. That being said, I felt a few chapters fell a little short of their mark and a still others were hard to keep going. I found myself skipping to the end of a couple chapters. The good thing about this book however is that it's almost a series of completely unrelated short stories so if you don't like the one you are reading...move on to the next one.I very much enjoyed learning of the OB/Gyn profession. That chapter was fairly fascinating."
Cheap.Cheap. Cheap,"Arrived with two of the four plastic tabs broke. Made from very cheap plastic. Dont waste your money, not worth it."
NOT A CUTE MOVIE AS EXPECTED. Raunchy language etc.,The movie is full of raunchy language and a ton of drug related scenes. Its very adult oriented as I expected but over the top in foul language and abuse. It would of been much better if toned down some. Not a very good Wahlberg movie considering his previous ones. Gen Y half high will probably love it though.
My Money was Well Spent,"I am a Somali Court Interpreter in Ontario, Canada.I bought this book online. My money was well spent, ie I am very satisfied with the way this book is written."
Big Wheel Review,Very easy to assemble. My son is a very tall 3 yr old and his legs are justLong enough to make the pedals go all theWay around. In a few months I expect to seeHim driving all over the driveway!
Did not understand!!!!,"I really cannot review the movie on account it did not have English sub-titles like it said it would. It says on the DVD box in English sub-titles. It's just in the Japanese language. It made me cranky! Now would you believe this? The previews on the DVD had English sub-titles! Be careful if you purchase this movie, if your expecting English you may not be getting it. I didn't. You've all been made aware of this major glitch."
It's ok.,I was a long time user of L'Oreal's Line Eraser eye cream and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued. I ordered this for the retinol (thinking I would have the same dramatic results as Line Eraser). I haven't noticed a difference at all and I've been using it everyday for 7 months. I'm very disappointed!
TOUCH THE BEAST,"As a child Quaid (Shaun Evans) witnessed his parents murdered with an ax as a child. He has nightmares and hallucinations about it. In college he gets together with two other students, Steven (Jackson Rathbone) and Cheryl (Hanne Steen) to do a study about fear and dread. Once the interview stage is complete, Quaid wants to take his study to the next level by making people face their fears.The film has all the elements of a good horror slasher: decent build-up, characters, nudity, cute ending, and some originality. For some reason it didn't grab me like it should have. Perhaps it was the non-likeability of Quaid, or the softness of Steven's character.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Erin Gavin, Laura Donnelly + others)"
unoriginal hacks,"give me a break. these guys are about the worst example of pre-fabricated mass marketed rocknroll i've ever heard. take equal parts pantera, mix with some corrosion of conformity, sprinkle some southern rock in the mix then subtract any trace of heart or originality and you have brand new sin. heavy rock's equivalent of a boy band. nothing original about it. if you're interested in this swill, do yourself a favor and check out some old sabbath, motorhead, or even the above mentioned pantera, COC. you'd be doing yourself a favor."
would recommend,I bought this litter box for one cat. It's convenient to use and I barely have to scoop at all. If the drawer isn't closed all the way it can leak kitty litter on the floor when you tip it over. Thinking of buying one for a family member with multiple cats.
Survivor,"Survivor, writeen by the author of Fight Club was an excellent book.The book catches your attention within the first couple pages. A possesed man realizes that the hardship he had in the past wont haunt him anymore.The book also has many insightful ideas. Like how to get stains out for any surface. Although this book is about a physco, he is very smart, and gets the reader very consumedI reccomend this book to many people for the fact that i hate reading, yet i couldnt get my head out of the book.I rate this book a solid 4, and i enjoyed reading it."
"classic game, but less durable than in the past","connect four is a classic strategy game for kids - i grew up loving this game. but it's more poorly made than the sets i used as a kid. thinner, lighter weight plastic. it'll last, but you'll definitely need to be gentle with it."
Must have,"When I started writing I was overwhelmed with all the elements I had to keep in mind, but what I found is that plot is basic. This book is like a tool chest for writers, filled with all the compartments in all the exact places I need them, keeping me organized. I can't imagine writing without this book out. This is the reference I have out at all times, I never put it away.When I tend to stray I go back to the book and it helps gets me back on track with my plotting.Because I liked the book, I bought the kit. I've saved hours and hours of rewrites."
Loss for words,"I couldn't put the book down. I felt as if I were apart of the love story, I could feel the pain they felt as easily as the love they had for one another."
Good deal,Bought the card and reader for less than everyone else charges for just the card on sale. Works fine in every product I've put it in so far.
A 12-Year Old Kid Reviews This Album For Your Enjoyment.....,"D00D MAN THIZ ALBUM ROCKZ, IT IZ SO KOOL!!!! F' THIS AND F' THAT! LIMP BIZKIT STYLE, THEY ARE THE BESTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, TRL R00LZ D00D! ALL THE KIDZ AT MY SKOOL LISTEN TO THIZ AN IF U DONT U SUK D00D!!!!

LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE ITS K00L D00DER!!!!! CARSON DALY RULEZ!!!People who bought this CD also bought: A swift kick in the ass.(WHOA I CUSSED D00D! K00LNEZZ!)"
11 years & still going strong!,"I've had this mug/thermos for 11 years (yes, really). It is bombproof. On a whim I just searched for it to see if I could buy another one--not to replace the first one, mind you, but to finally admit that all my other mugs are pathetic in comparison, and I should just buy a second one. I'm a tea drinker, but I don't use it to brew tea. I put brewed tea in it then hit the road. Only thing I don't love about it (?!?!) is that it keeps things hot so well, that I used to scald my poor mouth a lot. So, now I've learned to let things cool a bit before I put them in the thermos, or just run really cold water into it & let it sit for a bit (then empty) before putting freshly brewed tea into it. Ridiculously superior product."
As bad as Road Less Traveled was good,"I was deeply moved when I read Dr. Peck's ""The Road Less Traveled,"" and sought out this book for further enlightenment. I was sorely disappointed, and to this day I have trouble believing that these two books were penned by the same author.People of the Lie is a collection of case studies of troubled people who need help. Many of them are seeking that help when they enlist the services of Dr. Peck, who seems to have lost his sense of compassion. Most of these patients are suffering, but the best Dr. Peck can offer is to label them as, among other things, evil. I fail to see how this can help any patient, and this book has nothing to offer those whose goal is personal growth. Instead, read The Road Less Traveled."
server,Didn't get to see movie server kept shutting down and after the third or fourth time ....just give up...movie looked good but the server needs fixed
Ouch,"I've had this product for a while now and after using it for 15-20 minutes it hurts my ears. All of its weight is supported by the top of your ears and it leaves a dent from the pressure at the top of your ear, right where your glasses would sit.The headphones sound quality is ok, but I have people complain when I'm using the mic that I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Also the spongy mic cover has worn out and fallen off. There are 6 barbs like on a fish hook that held the cover on that are sort of sharp.I'm looking for a different headset."
This true HIPHOP!!,"Remembrance of my teenage and early young adult years. Russell Simmons CD remind me that I miss the real true HIPHOP and the fun I and my friends had in the 80's. I recommend this CD to the NEW GENERATION that has been cheated from REAL hiphop music.It's not about profanity nor the cars and women! It's about life. Life in the hood. NEW GENERATION learn from your history, it defines your future."
NOT ACCURATE,"I purchased this unit back in January and paid good money for it thinking Omron had a great piece of equipment that could help me monitor my blood pressure and record it on my PC. When I started to use it at the end of January I found my blood pressure to be high which worried me as it has been normal my whole life. I visited my doctor a couple of times up to now and he said it was normal. He suggested I bring in the unit when I have my physical which was yesterday. When he took a reading on his unit it was 130/70 and a pulse of 80 then it was taken on the Omron unit and read 159/98 and a pulse of 81. Only the pulse was accurate. I now have to pay shipping, insurance and an $8 check required by Omron to have this unit function properly. What a great warranty program - NOT!"
Smucking Long!!!,"Yes, Im yet another avid S.K fan, who will never give up on the master, despite being horribly dissappointedin his two lastest offerings, firstly the mediocre 'Cell', and now the neverending Liseys story.Why has King become so damn long winded?? His best novels have always been huge, but without a word to spare within an un-put-downable epic (eg Tommyknockers, IT, The Stand etc, etc)Liseys story dragged on like a long, boring movie full of dull characters. There were the odd moments of vintage King, but they were few and far between. I almost gave up halfway through, as the use of the ridiculous word 'smuck' made me want to throw the book away! I also found it irritating that Boo ya Moon was merely a poor replica of 'The Territories' within the brilliant 'Tallisman' (co written with Peter Straub)I still have faith in King and will continue to read everything that he offers us.. fingers crossed he has another great novel in him to rival his spectacular back catalogue."
excellent movie~~~~,"This movie is very interesting for me. Because four young boys showed their friendship and morality with undergoing all sorts of hardship. Second reason, everyone's character is funny especially Teddy like a psycho. And each character made harmony altogether in this story. First of all, each boy's character is good, nice, and innocent. They were very young but they kept friendship and morality. Besides they helped each other for their friends. I want to emphasize that is better point than normal adult."
Bounty Hunter Gold Digger Metal Detector Failed,"I purchased this product for an 11 year old. After assembling the unit, it worked fine for approximately five minutes, then stopped operating completely. I replaced the batteries, and still nothing. Returned it."
Good detail but much too dry,"You can tell that Ryan has done tremendous research into Operation Market Garden. But his writing style comes off as much too dry for anyone but the most avid WW II enthusiast. I am very much interested in this topic, but am not a rabid WW II fanatic. As such, I have tried no less than 6 times to read this book and can never finish it. I usually get to about 1/3 of it and have to put it back on the shelf.So be forewarned, it will not appeal to people with a passing intereset in WW II."
don't be fooled by its title,I had higher hopes for this CD and have been disappointed. There are only 2 relaxation tracks on it. The first one isn't bad though it would have been better if there were more birth affirmations and something to prepare you for a positive labour experience. But the 2nd track is just appalling. In fact the background music has the opposite effect from relaxation and left me feeling anxious. I even had my husband try this CD and he said it got on his nerves and made him more tense after just 5 minutes!
It did it's job!,"This book is a great general guide through science for life. Gives you the run down on cells, genes, dna, planet history, Etc."
WOW!,This book gives you KNOWLEADGE with great photo and captions with all!!Just order this book to find out what I am talking about!!!
Couldn't push full bandwidth,"I am running this cable from my home theater system to my projector on the other end of the room. This cable works flawlessly at 1080p 24hz, but when upped to 50hz or 60hz, it really struggles to keep full bandwidth. It certainly supports the frequency, but about two or three times per minute I would lose signal for a second then it would come back. Secondly there was noise in the line (only while at > 24hz) causing horizontal lines to intermittently show up for a brief second.I'm now going to have to order some better cables as 24hz isn't sufficient for my home theater system, fast movement results in a blur and a frame is dropped about every two seconds."
Good but I had to stop taking them,"Overall great product for someone who consistently has intense work outs and needs the supplements. I had to stop taking them because I would get a little nauseous from them, the smell of the pills is really strong, and the multiple giant pills just became too much for me."
I'm going back to the scissors,"I've been using this product for a few months now and I've decided that I'm going back to good-old scissors. For the first few weeks, it worked great. Then it started to pull hairs. I thought it might be the batteries, so I replaced them, but no dice. It doesn't exactly yank the hairs, so if you can deal with a bit of stinging, then it's not a big issue."
soul sufer,soul sufer is a great movie i wonder will there be a soul sufer 2 and i like true true stories
Does what it is suppose to do,"First off I bought it from Lowes Twice lol, the first time the tool was well designed wrong( it was flawed). It would reaming the pipe it was suppose to but the actually screw driver part of it was to long for the couples for the pipe so I had to take it back. The second works but have not need to use it in months since I have not been on a job where I needed to use much if any pipe as of lastMaybe it is just me but Klein has some nice tools but for some reason I seem to buy ones with flaws. Like the 10:1 U just got( I bought two) the first one works great, the second one some of it is loose and sometime falls out if it grips the screw any."
Not as good as others...,"I bought this DVD to give my 17 month old some more of the ""older"" baby einstein dvd's. Compared to some of the newer ones, this one is not my favorite. I was a music minor in college and was thrilled with the idea of the instruments. Unfortunately, my son did not really like this DVD. The puppet shows were very short and not very entertaining."
Different reading,"This is a book for older kids who want to have some different reading, besides chapter books. My daughter likes to read this book before bed. It has some off-the-wall stories which appeal to her sense of humor. It has some ""adult type"" topics [like the woman hiding in her closet naked] which may not be suitable for all children."
Romance?,"This was not romantic!!! I can't believe the good reviews this got. There is nothing romantic about rape, revenge and cruelty. The heroine did wrong, but the so called hero really went overboard punishing her. Theres no tender feelings ever revealed. Everyone else is excused and rewarded for their part in the deceit and abuse. Rowena is reviled, humiliated, and threatened with physical abuse at every turn. That is in addition to his unwanted forced sexual attacks. It's enough to make anyone swoon. How romantic!!!! REALLY! Skip this one."
Heavy duty!!,"I got 2 sets of these for my grandsons, they came today, tried them on myself, and they will be a perfect fit for the 10 yr olds!!I even punched the wall a couple of times, very sturdy!!!"
Perfect title to a near-perfect novel,"Jonathan Franzen fully deserves the awards his latest novel has garnered. I was intrigued throughout with what his title *The Corrections* meant to the story and to the superbly wrought characters of this old-very modern family. He did not let me down. The word (Corrections) was one of Franzen's many scapels with which he expertly sliced and diced this family, modern culture, and all geographies between St. Jude and Eastern Europe. His knowledge is astonishing. His metaphors are wit perfected -- a pierce of the rapier that leaves a bloodless and painless wound that the victim never feels. It is not fair -- where Franzen's characters real people -- to so completely penetrate their protective masks. But he does. And the reader benefits, joyously and most pleasurably."
More Blah Blah from the Dorkball talking head,"If you want to completely waste your time by reading a monumentally unimportant book,then you can read this garbage.This guy thinks he knows the game,how its played,etc.He is actually a big part of the dumbing down and brainwashing of America.That is his game and he does it in the most dorky,chicken#%&! way humanly possible.If you want to know how the game is played,check out books by people who will give you the truth behind the show,not by these lame keepers of the lies like Dorkball here.The main Lie is 911.Look into it.Chris is nothing but an undeserving high paid dose of Dork!"
Great and intense...,"I am a histroy buff, and I thought this was a great movie. Very intense, very good quality production, war is indeed hell...."
"Creepy, Intricate, and Entertaining","Chris Wooding has created an intricate world full of believable mosters (both wych-kin and human) that will appeal to readers of fantasy and horror alike. The characters can fall a little flat, and Alaizabel, the so-called heroine of the book, seems incredibly wimpy and helpless to me (despite being described as strong and courageous within the book), but the unique setting interesting plot more than make up for any character shortcomings. The plot moves along at a very nice pace - fast enough to keep the reader interested, but slow enough that we can pause to take in the intricacies of the alternand ate history-type world as well. The ending climactic sequence especially is a page-turner that will keep readers up way past bedtime. ""The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray"" is definitely worth checking out."
SanDisk MP3 Companion,Summary:I use it with a 1GB memory stick and if it didn't lockup all the time it would be a cool little product. As it stands it's not worth the money.Pro:Sounds great.Light weight.Allows me to switch drives for different music.Battery life lasts about a day.Con:Locks up for no reason.Poor construction of the battery cover (thin bit of plastic holding on the cover).
GRE Prep Aid,"I began studying with this test prep guide about 6 weeks before the exam. I studied up to three hours a night, covering the basic sections and dipping into the advanced sections, albeit minimally. I made note cards for vocabulary words I was not familiar with (and words whose meanings I did not know). In addition, I borrowed a friend's copy of Barron's Pass Key To The GRE, which is a slimmed-down version of the book I am reviewing. They did their job; I amassed a composite score of 1200 (no word on my essays yet).There is a CD that accompanies this book. ***Do NOT buy this guide simply because of the CD!!*** While there are computer-adaptive tests to practice with, many of the questions/reading passages are repeated.For the price of the books that Barron's offers, they are valuable study helpers. Stay committed to preparing for the test and you will have little to worry about. Best wishes to you."
***AWESOME***,This TV is great. It is exactly what I wanted and at the right price. Dealing with Amazon was a chore - first one showed up broken and Samsung could not fix it - so 30 days after the first delivery I got the replacement - which is perfect.
Picks up at the end,"The author spends too much time in characters' heads. Conceivably this could be interesting but not here. About 1/4 of the way through I got fed up and skipped over about half of the book, reading only a paragraph here and there. However the last third or quarter is so riveting that I stayed up 2 hours too late simply to finish it, and the next day I bought the book that comes after this one. My general impression of Weber books is that they start slowly, filling in character, but they accelerate, so that at the end they are very exciting and moving - it's the endings that keep me coming back. Same occurs here, but the beginning of the book is too slow."
Healthy?,"If you consider hydrogenated oils (Margerine-Butter buds), and canned foods that are in some of the recipes healthy. Also Microwave cooking? This book should be called 30 minute meals."
good PT tool,"Works fine, just a little rough or sharp on the edges, be careful not to scrape someone's tender skin."
"They do the job, but can tear after several uses","Don't expect these to travel with you around the globe, after three or four uses the seals can get tears in them. Another concern for air travel is that using these, you can easily get over the 50 lb weight limit with large backs, which can cost you $25 per bag on some airlines."
Disappointed,"Was excited at first site & feel. The cushion is very well padded & comfy. Right away though, I noticed it was hard to roll on our commercial carpet. (Don't have this issue with other stools in the office.)We had only had it in the office a week when my associate sat down on it & 2 of the legs broke right in half near the wheel canister. Couldn't believe how defective it was. I'll spend $20 now for an Earthlite or similar product."
Not For Everyone,"One of the many spoofs of ""Star Wars"" and the films it inspired, this one doesn't work for me. I get it, but I only chuckled twice and grinned once. I understand that the ineptness was deliberate, but the bad timing on the delivery of the jokes, which might have also been intentional, just made me groan.Based on most of the other reviews, I'm in the minority here. That's OK, but if you're considering purchasing or renting this one, consider the other movies the lovers of this one also liked. If you don't love two or more, you might want to skip this one."
America's History with the Kent family,It has been over 30 years since I read these books the first time. They are even more relevant now. Fascinating writing about our counrty's birth as experienced by the fictional Kent family.
Radio City Music Hall 9/21/2005,"Unbelievable show in a famous hall that was packed, while Elton John down the street at Madison Square Garden couldn't sell out.I took my daughter, a 21-year old student at NYU and she was wowed! It takes alot to impress her because she sees so many NYC shows.But, she was so happy, had her Mom listen to most of the concert via cell phone. And, my daughter knew all of the songs that she had not heard since she was a little baby. Needless to say, Sittin In Again is on her Ipod and also playing at Pasta Presto, a cute, Italian restaurant in NYC whenever she waitresses there. The regular customers love it so much, that my daughter has left her CD that we bought at the concert, so that the restaurant can use it. And, spread the good feelings!"
versatile wide-angle,I got it because I intend to use it on both my film and my digital bodies. For ultra wide angles I'll use it with film (Nikon N-80) and for more conventional wide angle with my Nikon D-200. It's one of three lenses I'm taking with me on vacation to the mountain states. The others are a Nikkor 28mm - 85mm and a Nikkor 70mm - 300mm with 2X Tamron SP doubler. Since I don't yet have photoshop or similar I wanted to be able to take real wide shots without having to paste them together.
Superior looking sturdy frame,"Wow, This frame really catches your eye when you look at a car from behind. I put it on the rear plate of my 2010 Silver Maxima and it looks great with the other chrome detailing which exists on my car. Its heavier and not one of those cheap bendable plate frames. Id be willing to pay double for this frame being that the quality and appearance are even better than expected. 5 star purchase with no second thoughts."
Excellent Merry Xmas from Vienna,"This video is excellent the songs were great. Being invited to sing by Placido Domingo is a great privilege. Obviously he thinks Michael Bolton's voice warrants this music. Placido and Michael sing a duet of the ""Ave Maria"" that is wonderful, Michael did a great job singing this. He also has a great video on dvd with Luciano Pavarotti, called Pavarotti and Friends For the Children of Bosnia, and also a great duet with Renee Fleming opera singer on another CD of Michael Boltons, ""My Secret Passion"" of all the Italian aria's."
Ripping Vinyl Function a Rip Off,"I bought this because it is advertised as the solution to ripping vinyl into digital media. Yes, it rips it, then it gives you a nice UI to MANUALLY TYPE IN the artist, album, AND SONG TITLES. Their media player used to apply this info to a list of 1..N tracks. It seems this s/w does not go to their db and gather the info for you. It is a real half hearted attempt. Maybe I expect too much from the largest s/w company in the world."
Ten Days That Shook the World,I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
This book reads the way life feels,"Alice McDermott has a genius for capturing the telling detail in every scene she describes, so that everything seems both recognizable and seen for the first time. The novel is masterful in conveying the quality of memory and of the mysteries that exist in all families - mysteries that everyone has an opinion on but that can never be finally resolved. How wonderful to read a book in which there are no heroes or villains - just people like the ones we know, occasionally elevated by their dreams or their loyalties or their sense of humor, then sunk by their weaknesses; and what a pleasure to read a book in which relationships within family and neighborhood are central without being the crux of some hideous abuse that explains everything. In life, and in Charming Billy, no one thing explains everything."
Prostitution in the Afternoon,"A rather dated and arguably misogynous film about a beautiful upper middle class housewife who has everything but prostitution in the afternoon. Those who ""understand"" the picture may marvel at how it ridicules the hypocrisy of society (how shocking!) and other brilliant ideas, but most people probably enjoy this film because of Catherine Deneuve, who went on to bigger and better things playing a call girl opposite Burt Reynolds."
Great idea; smaller than expected,"I had high hopes for the Kata H-12 holster case, but it barely held my Canon 5D with a standard lens. The side pockets would not hold my zoom and wide angle lenses. The H-14 may be roomier and work better, but instead I opted for the Lowepro Off Trail belt pack which is more modular and worked well while I covered a concert event."
Top Secret Receipes,this book is great easy to use I highly recomend it the receipes are just like the restarunts
Another GREAT Season of AA - Could Have More Resources,"Its very exciting that the Ancient Alien Theory is FINALLY coming out to the mainstream public after all these years of really being so quiet. I have been following these theories for many years and when I first saw Ancient Aliens on History Channel I was stoked. Granted, some of the information and opions can edge on the side of a little far fetched which can be a negative if we're trying to educate people about all the real facts. I wish the show would err away from some of the crazier scenarios and stick to the historical facts, and less ""yeah right"" ideas. Overall, awesome information. They really should include more of the studies of some of the fields great research like Sitchin, Edmund Marriage, Lloyd Pye, Lucien Nocelli etc. They all have great other views and have put a lot of time and research into the field, and thier points would be a geat addition to the series."
Battery,When i go the watch it came with a battery and I just thought it was an extra and then my watch died and when i tried to replace the battery it was really difficult and once i got it in the watch didnt work right anymore
3 and a half- good stuff,"great songs are all over this album. in fact, every song is great in its own way. it has standard rock filtered through electronic beats and colorful, textured vocals. these guys really are talented. Also there are acoustic songs and ballads.so why not give it 4 or 5 stars? well, i guess i shouldn't judge it like this, but considering all the praise, hype, and other albums radiohead has done, this one slipped under my expectations. That's not to say it ain't good cause it is. it's as good as people say it is, i'm just biased. I like it. blah blah blah. **plus you know 5 stars gets overused- one reason an album should get 5 stars is when it stands the test of time, doesn't get dated. Not cause it just came out and it's caTCHY (which i'm not saying this is)**"
Great for Poetry Lovers Everywhere:),"I love this calendar! Everyday I get to read a wonderful short poem or quote about poetry. Plus if I wanted to, I could carry the poems in my pocket. :) I hope they come out with one every year. A wonderful idea!"
EXCELLENT,"this is one of those CD's you've gotta take along on the next roadtrip. great sound, very heavy, these songs never get old. lyrics are awesome, especially in ""bad religion..."" you've gotta love this stuff."
A sweet fairytale spoiled by foul language and radical animal activist agenda,"First of all, do not let your children see this film unless you want them hearing profanities including s--- and bulls--- and more. I can't fathom why they chose to sully such a sweet film with such filth.Secondly, be warned that this film advocates views consistent with the far fringe of animal activists. This movie is completely against hunting and fur coats, takes a dim view of guns and gun owners, and plays on the edges of advocating against consuming meat.So, even if you can find a ""clean"" edition of the movie that is edited for the harsh profanities, you're left with a movie that promotes some extreme political views that sully the otherwise sweet tale of a loveable-but-misunderstood creature who touches the lives of the Henderson family."
Book review of The innocentby Harlan Coban,"This was my first contact with the writing of Mr. Coban, and I started reading the prologue while walking from my mailbox, into the kitchen and on to my favorite chair without lifting my eyes from the pages. The book was fast paced, interesting and had a thousand quirks and turns. I felt sorry for the protaganist, wished him luck and was happy with the final outcome. It was a book I could not put down until I turned the final page."
Not Everyone Is Ready For This Music,"""Have You Forgotten"" is worth the price of admission. Buy this album for this contemporary classic and roll forward with the rest of the CD like you were meant to. When all is said and done you will wish you had found Mark( the creative genius behind all of this) a whole lot sooner. Incidentally, if you want an even more melodic version of ""Have You Forgotten"" then you will have to buy the soundtrack to the film ""Vanilla Sky"". You should own them both!!"
Bad Instincts,"This book has been called ""the Devil Wears Prada for vegans"" numerous times, and what an apt comparison; ""Animal Instinct"" is just as poorly written and completely uninteresting---an embarrassment, in my opinion, to writers everywhere. Also like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" this book is a thinly-veiled attempt at revenge, and for what I am not certain. What both of these books make painfully clear: a ""fictional"" novel is no place for airing dirty laundry, unless, of course, one possesses the actual ability to write. Otherwise, Ms. Hayes might have kept this banal tale locked within the pages of a journal; this story is not interesting enough for mass consumption."
Somewhat Helpful,OK but not great. The female voice is not very soothing. I recommend Susie Mantell's Your Present; I believe it is far more effective.
Busting Lose from the Money Game,"Excellent book!!! Mr. Scheinfeld brings the most important elements of life together with ease and clarity. This is likely to be the best ""money"" book on the market because the author prioritizes how we do life from a greater perspective, and reveals what's REALLY going on here. If you're ready tobust loose from the illusions of life that are holding you captive, get this book. If you're not ready to take that step - get the book anyway and let it work on your subconscious mind. :)I actually recommended this book to my listeners on my radio show last week."
Meh.,"These games are tried and true, but kind of boring and redundant. They are mostly focused on fun for the riders and not so much fun for the horses. If you want something unique and different, get The Pony Games Book. It has original games whereas this book has a lot of games like Red Light, Green Light and Around the World, which almost everyone has played. The Pony Games Book is a more useful learning tool."
A good read!,"I'm an avid fan of Elizabeth Peters' books, including the Amelia Peabody series. This one is good but not one of the best. I thought it was slow but still - Elizabeth Peters is Elizabeth Peters and always worth reading."
Nothing New Here just a Different Format,I had only heard about the Author and his company before running across this book. I was disappointed in the book. It is okay but mostly his 'laws' are redone from many writers before him. Seemed to me to be more promo for his company and his work and I guess that is okay. He is successful with his company so he is doing something right but didnt resonate with me.
Not memorable,This book occurred a couple of years into the series so the characters were still being fleshed out so the focus was more on finding new missions to write about. While everything was traced back to Cardassian involvement showing the same narrow focus that the first few seasons did. Also the books needed to get broader in scope and characterization. This book was a slow start and the only part that was true to the series was the Quark and Odo conflict.
"Funny, but....","This book is good for some laughs, but is NOT a real survival manual. For that, the best by far is the U.S. Army Survival Manual. Check that one out before buying this one."
angmomof3,"I got this for my daughter at christmas and before I got it I got an email from the company saying that they no longer carried this product there was a newer version, so i took the newer version plus a 10 dollar credit but it wasnt worth it at all. My daughter didnt even like the newer one and its not near as good as the one that was pictured, so needless to say I am going to have to purchase another one this year!!"
A little disappointed,I thought this book was going to be a great book by what the discription had said. I wanted a book covering maintainence not the history of where the impreza came from. Still a really neat book though!
Tres belle? Quel bagatelle!,"This is a fairly mediocre piece of work...Programmatic [70's style feminist] work, executed in the style of a Radley Metzger film. However, as it is short, the programmatic mediocrity doesn't last long. Mercifully.Of course Oates is (or, was) a much finer writer (& critic--despite her ridiculous misreading of D. H. Lawrence's poetry!) than this work would indicate. It is always disappointing to see such tripe passed off a serious art, when it is in fact brought about by a blatant attempt to cater to a dominant ideology...Like so much Soviet art in the Thirties & Forties, etc.That there are absolutely no characters to empathize with in this muddled story is no argument in its favor either.One can easily find better employment of several hours than plodding through this contrived dreck which reads like the panic attack-induced phantasies of an anxious parent with a teenager preparing to leave home the first time for college."

"Evocative imagery, good mystery, great characters","I've held on to my paperback copy of this book for 20 years. I reread it every couple of years, and am happy once again to watch the magic happen. Ancient Chinese myths come to life, along with rascals, palace intrigue, beautiful maidens (and some who you don't turn your back on!.) Very few fantasy books reach this level of creativity and surprise, plus excellent plot and pace. Find this book, read it, and you'll be pleased."
A surprisingly average SW release,"This will no doubt go down as big disappointment. After the awesome Television City Dream, this CD is very weak. I've listened to it over and over again, and I just can't get myself to like it. Sure there are a couple of good songs (Acknowledge, Last Night), but the majority of the songs just aren't catchy or melodic. The cover of the Cranberries song ""Linger"" is also pretty weak. Overall, I've heard worse music in my life... but not by this band."
aquiacleer 110 power filter,"this power filter does a good job of filtering water but is verry noisey pump is loud and the water coming out of it souinds like a rushing river i replaced it with a aquiatop 400uv it is verry quiet like it states and does a great job of filtering my overstocked 55gal tank worth every penny, dont waste your money on the aquiaclear."
lost at sea,I think Steven Callahan is an amazing person to have survived so long at sea.It was a good book but somehow I can't say I was totally gripped by it though I appreciate how difficult it must have been to fill a book with a subject matter like this.The thing I found most fascinating after his amazing survival was his interaction with the fish that surrounded him they became characters in book that otherwise would have only one - him. The relationship was necessary to him in both social and primal way. He needed their company and he needed to eat them. In a way I was a little disappointed that it wasn't explored further and I would have loved to hear his own take on the relationship in the aftermath of his rescue.
Best Cookbook ever,"This has turned out to be one of the best recipe books from the White House. Verdon really outdid himself and I still use some of the recipies today. had to fight cousin for the book. Then sadly I lost it when home burned. Therefore, the reason Im ordering again. your kitchen library shouldn't be without this one."
"Good, but not up to Hawking's standard","I immensely enjoyed A Brief History of Time, and had high hopes for this book as well. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book full of interesting things, but there is far too much repitition, both with A Brief History of Time and withing this book itself. It seemed that he explained his ""the only boudary conditition is that there is no boundary"" theory in every essay. Good material, but you won't find much in here that you didn't already know if you read A Brief History of Time. I would recommend skipping this and going straight to The Universe in a Nutshell, a more recent Hawking book."
Boring ASL game,"It's simply no fun. It dosen't even teach anything. The stories are boring and in the car game it says, ""Don't drive off the road!"" but you CAN'T go off the road even if you try. The stories are no fun, neither are the games. The stories are like PRESCHOOL stories and the games are too. They should of called it ""ASL for Preschoolers"". It dosen't teach very much when the person signs and the puppy suit dosen't even look good. Why it's 2 stars instead of 1 is because the car game is a tiny bit fun and the stories are a little funny. Signed, Chocolate Dog."
More restful sleep,"I've had a neck condition for about a decade. This pillow has allowed me to get more sleep through the night. It took a little while to adjust to the pillow (e.g., having to stay in better alignment while in bed), but once I adjusted, I noticed less stiff necks and more restful sleep, once I get up."
"Low fat yet, great flavor",I am a mixer at heart. I love my oatmeal every morningwith a hearty measure of Familia granola tossed in.Very tasty
Looks cheap,Shipping was very fast and came in a velvet pouch but don't waste your money. It looks cheap on and feels cheap. Very dissapoibted in this purchase.
New Design,These are the best vacuum marinators for the money. One of mine came with a defect where the fill hole had not been fully drilled out. I drilled it out and it works fine. The pump is the easiest to hook up and use- no hookup needed. These hold vacuum for a long time so medium term storage is a second good use.
Takes long time to read the chords,"I was very excited when i was waiting for this book, but was disappointed w/o any grids. It takes most people along time to figure out the correct fingerings for all these chords. would have helped alot to have some guide.The comping patterns might be good ,but if it takes forever to learn them its not useful. I've moved on to other resourcesk"
Toddler likes the blues,"My toddler likes the music on this CD. When I first heard it, I wasn't sure it would go over well---my husband is not crazy about the music---but my 2 year old likes it! The songs are catchy and the music is nice and easy listening."
It's Okay,"There's nothing revolutionary here. But the music is enjoyable enough to listen to. Forgettable, but enjoyable, nonetheless."
yuk,"I really found this book to be useless. I never did find out why men can't commit but lots of stories about how men don't commit. No real information, no real depth into the psychology of men. Useless."
"Good for beginners, not for programmers","I would have liked to see a brief of Crystal files. A short chapter on VB or Delphi components would have been a nice addition. More on how to work/make the important aspect of boilerplates or templates. EXAMPLES, EXAMPLES, EXAMPLES is the key. Crystal is a quasi-DP tool. So a CD or chapter with a few templates would certainly appeal to many. If you work with databases, go for it. If you are a developer, wait for version 2. When one tackles a serious tool like Crystal, one will not encounter many dummies. All in all a job well done and very easy to follow."
"Watch out, homies, for Santa's Swingin' Sack.","L.A. based Radio station KROQ releases a Christmas CD every year, hosted by deejays Kevin & Bean. This was the 1998 release. It features a mix of Christmas songs and comedy routines. Most of the songs are good and most of the comedy bits are funny. Several of the tracks are only available on this CD, so it's well worth seeking out."
Not a film about love at all,"Acting is first class. Of course, the attractive & superficial looks of both actors are bound to draw you inBut it is a dark story, with characters one can only struggle to feel any sympathy forThe film shows the pain and obvious destruction resulting from certain types of behaviour. So the outcome becomes more predictable the longer the film runs, and I became more and more disinterested in the characters with every minute"
terrible selection !,"This CD is live, in concert. The music is terrible! not like the Brenda lee one is expecting. It is awful I can not give it One star ! False info on it's description !The title fits the product!"
Atlantis,"Tired of buying over hyped DVD's. This is a plot from a 50 year old ""B"" Movie, and a little of 60 year old Flash Gordon. It's not much more than that. The only plus was sound, but not worth the $... I paid for it. Very, very few movies are lately."
I want my money back!,"Being a lyricist (ck. home.earthlink.net/~paulkruger), I've been using Wood's Unabridged Rhyming Dictionary for so many years the book has begun to fall aprt. (Never realized till a few weeks ago, the edition I have was published in 1943.) It was time to replace it. Or so I thought.Clement Wood's genius was to divide each section so that you could see at a glance words which have the same sound (e.g., approved, improved, reproved, etc.) and, therefore, were not true rhymes. So what does this appallingly dreadful edition do? They list all words alphabetically regardless of sound!No wonder one of the editors is named Bogus."
Terrific,"This is one of the few albums I own in which I like almost every song on it. My only real criticism is with the ordering of the songs--I have an old 33 1/3 record, not the CD. This, of course, is one of the advantages of a CD. The album includes:SIDE 1: cheap love, you make me want to make you mine (my favorite song on the entire album), hurt, old flame (title song), stuck in the middle with you (recorded by other artists too).SIDE 2: feel a whole lot better (catchy melody, interesting lyrics), what can I do with my heart, with you (upbeat), one touch (very good IMHO), let your woman take care of you.Most of the songs are quite upbeat; all are well done with clever lyrics. It's a very fine album--especially if you are into her genre."
Red Fox cocoa butter,This stuff is wonderful! I needed a moisturizer that worked on my hard dry skin. And the best thing about it is you only need to use a small amount to get the job done.
John Wayne being John Wayne.,A lot of fun to watch. If your kids have never seen the Duke.This is a good one to start them on. No one can play parts likethese better than John Wayne. Great addition the my John Waynelibrary.
Horridly Uncomfortable,"These are my thoughts after about 24-hours of use.Comfort:These headphones were extremely uncomfortable for me (my hat size is 7 1/8""). I usually don't get headaches, but these managed to give me a headache after 20 minutes, without fail, every time I put them on. Maybe it's circumaural headphones in general for me because even Sony's MDR V150 were infinitely more comfortable (which are universally hated by audiophiles). Instead I bought Beyerdynamic's DT 235 (http://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-DT-235-Headphone-White/dp/B001BAKTFO) which are not circumaural, but my ears are small enough so that they basically are.Sound:I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was excellent to me; even without an amp.Craftsmanship:Fairly well built, it is made of plastic. The biggest cause of concern for me was the thin cord, but the connector was covered in a metal spring contraption, which made it seem very solid."
What a story!,"I just finished reading Owen Meany yesterday and I am sad that the book had to come to an end. I loved the story! I have had a lot of good friends in my life but none like Owen. The book made me think of the silly things I've done with my friends and I thought ""the shot"" was just another quirky thing they did together. I really made me stop and replay the entire book in my mind when it finally came to a close. I know I will read it again."
No water pressure,"Water tastes good, but if you mind waiting more than 2 minutes to fill your glass up then look elsewhere!!"
A Solid Debut CD - But Nothing More,"The only good song on the CD is Absolutely (Story of a Girl). The others are very slow-paced and the harmonies are haphazard. I must say that the band has tried very hard to make a good CD, and it does show, but it is not worth the money. If you are buying the CD for Absolutely, don't. Buy the single instead."
wonderfully warm pop,"This is the pop record Air was trying to make with 10,000 Hz. Warm keyboards (with lots of electric piano, one of my favorite sounds), subtle electronics, great melodies. Andy Chase is better known as one-third of the sophisticated pop trio Ivy, but after this record, he'll be known as a pop auteur in his own right. Reclusive popster Eric Matthews helps out on many tracks as well. For fans of Prefab Sprout, the Pearlfishers, Matthews and the like. Very, very nice stuff."
Versatile Beauty Oil,"This is a great all around beauty oil product. i use it for my skin, face, and hair. It needs to be used in moderation. I have acne prone skin and so far it has not caused any problems in fact it calms my skin beacuse i use a lot of other harsh products. very nice product."
THIS IS GREAT!,"Some of the best memories of my youth were watching the NFL GAME OF THE WEEK, THIS WEEK IN PRO FOOTBALL and the other weekly highlight shows on Saturday afternoon. Forget the (live) games on Sunday, they didn't have the Sam Spence soundtrack. This CD is great and proves Spence was a first class composer/musician. I have wear marks on my copy, especially PONY SOLDIERS. Where is Volume 2?"
Essential Genesis,"This is one of that albums that puts you up in a dark day. There's very good songs here, like the outstanding Mama one of the best of the album, That's All, a great and very nice tune Home By The Sea, and Second Home By The Sea, a very more prog pop approach, Illegal Alien, an OK song, Taking It All To Hard, a very nice pop tune, Just a Job To do, another good one, Silver Rainbow, a very beautiful tune, and the nice It's Gonna Get Better. It's one of the best album from pop Genesis, together with Invisible Touch! If you're new to Genesis, get one prog album (I recommend Foxtrot) and one from the pops (I recommend this one)."
Let Down,"I was extremely hopeful this would work for my 4 year old.. But after the first application, she simply would suck for a few moments, make a face and then back to normal.. I tried everything to make this work without making her sick.. Nothing worked. :("
Makes no sense,"The entire time I was reading this, I felt like I was reading a sequel to a book I never read. Something is missing. I will keep the book on the shelf, but as of yet, I just don't get it. Unless you have some secret knowledge, don't buy this book!"
I would love to recommend this but ...,"This software is fast, capable, and easy to use. If only it didn't crash so much. I've updated my drivers, reinstalled the application, etc. to no avail. Sigh. I just cannot recommend version 2.0.1."
That's how they do it in the South: retarded,"I always keep forgetting his name, he doesn't repeat it enough. He seems to be bitter that girls didn't want him back then. Why should have girls wanted you back then? You were a loser, you didn't have anything going for you until now. Actually, you're still a loser except you're on MTV now."
3.5 stars- On a decline after the mega hit Long Distance Voyager,"This is definitely not in the same league as LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, but that one's definitely hard to beat. The songs that make this album desirable are ""Blue World"", ""Sitting At The Wheel"", and ""Meet Me Halfway"". Not really a bad album though, it just doesn't have the six great songs that LDV did. But everybody's different and some Moody Blues fans might just fall in love with this one. Enjoy!!!"
"Keep looking, over priced and out of date","This notebook is out of date and is way out classed by rivals in the same price range.What I don't like:SDRAM? Most notebooks in this price range offer DDR-SDRAM. DDR transmits twice the data with each clock, making it much faster. SDRAM has been abandoned.1.3 GHz Athlons: They run hot and lack SSE-2. SSE-2 is a feature built into current Intel and future AMD CPUs. If you don't have it, software that uses it will run slower. This includes major products like Windows, Adobe, and many games.ATI RAGE MOILITY graphics chipset? Very old news with almost no 3D features. Notebooks that cost 30% less are at least offering the ATI Radeon M6-P or even ATI 7500 chipsets.If this notebook was half the price I could endorse it. At this price it is highway robbery. Either look at Toshiba, HP, Gateway or Dell, or move up the Sony price range into one of their newer P4 based notebooks. I'm sure this left over is about to be discontinued."
Too Touchy Feely,"If you are not the touchy feely type, then this book will make your skin crawl. It has ""cute"" chapter titles, like ""Rally Round The Boob"" and tidbits such as ""The Lumpectomy Dance.""If you want a helpful, not silly, book, I recommend ""Just Get Me Through This"" instead. I also felt the writing was very self-congratulatory. Again, I understand cancer is a horrible disease and everyone's approach to dealing with it is going to be different. But this book is not for the serious minded or for anyone seeking detailed information about treatment."
Made it to page 87,"Normally I never give up on a book until at least 100 pages. This was an exception.The opening and first chapter seemed so promising! Then, in the second chapter, it fell apart with weirdness. Not one of the characters was is any way normal or likeable. The ""action"" was nonexistant. Worst of all, it started introducing lesbian characters, atheism and other unsavory content.I can honestly say I found nothing redeeming in this book. If it was supposed to have a message, it totally escaped me. I read several hundred books a year, and was bitterly disappointed in this lemon."
Generally pleased,"I used the machine for the first time last night. We have hardwood floors, but there is a white 5 x 7 area rug in the living room that we really needed to clean. I figured that getting this machine would probably cost no more than a single professional cleaning. The machine did remove an amazing, or maybe the right word is disgusting, amount of dirt from the rug. My only disappointment is that around the border of the rug there is a pattern with raised areas in the shape of leaves. The machine was not able to clean effectively down between those raised areas. I'm not sure what I will do about those spots, but if you are getting it to clean regular carpet then this limitation shouldn't pose a problem for you."
Quirky,"We had a mix of kids and adults watch. Some of us really liked it, but some did mot at all. It is a mix of horror movie and humor that will not resonate with everyone."
Important Information - Highly recommend!,"I read this during my second pregnancy so I could prepare myself better for my planned c-section. I had a surprise c-section with my first child. So I really wanted to prepare mentally for my next one. I learned so much from this book and related to everything in it for the post-recovery chapters. I really think every pregnant woman should read this, especially if it's your first pregnancy. You will learn so much and gain insight of what to expect and how to recover well. I had hard recoveries, so I am glad that I could learn more about my body and how to deal with emotions post-birth. I love this book. I appreciate the authors for writing this book."
Not too bad...,"A bit snug (especially the knee pads) on a thin-framed tall 8 year old. He wears them, but it's a challenge for him to get them on/off."
Not Dostoyevskys Best,These two stories do not impress me. They are not near the best of Dostoyevesky. Stick to the longer novels of Dostoyevsky to see why he is considered one of the greatest writers in history.
Another Flopp,"From now on , I will listen to the song samples Amazon offers , because Room on Fire , as Fountains of Wayne Wellcome ... and Newsboys Thrive and ... ect... are uninspiring recordings of mediocre value . The money I spend thinking that Rolling Stone , etc... know what they are talking about is a shame , when I could B listening to more inspiring talent . Oh well , this should teach me a lesson ...."
It's cool,"Scooby doo is awesome! Go back in time, and prepare to have a great time with Scooby and his pals!"
Unauthorised!!,"So much for revealing the ""secrets"" of Cabales Escrima. Unfortunatly this book is quite the opposite. Wiley misquotes Angel on the back cover. Angel gave permission for a series of books on Cabales Serrada Escrima - Not just one book with all the good techniques left out. I'm sure the Grand Master would have been bitterly dissapointed with this effort by Wiley. The idea was to spread the knowledge of this fantastic system throughout the world in its entirety through a series of books - Not for an insecure person to greedily hoard the techniques for himself to reveal at seminars and private tuition."
Only as good as its weak zipper,"The body of this case is sturdy, all right, but the nylon zipper isn't up to the challenge. It's easy to stress the zipper because when you open this case it won't lie flat unless you push the zipper tab impossibly far into the spine with the tips of your fingers. But this isn't even how my zipper failed, because it failed from a closed position. Once the zipper splits, it absolutely fails to self-heal -- no matter how carefully you re-mate it, it will split again in an instant. Now I have about 100 CDs that I have no secure home for until I buy a replacement case."
Wrong Adaptor,"The unit arrived and I hooked it up to the roof and went to add the F to SMB adaptor to the Delph Skyfi unit and guess what, it does not fit. They sent me the wrong adaptor for my unit. I check on Amazona and could find no place to contact them or the vendor. Really frustrated."
"Good Pushpins - Reusable Box, Not So Much","They're just pushpins. Sturdy, functional pushpins. Very decent value for the price. My only complaint is the ""reusable box"" if they want to call it a reusable box, then I don't think it would be to much to ask for the box to latch. It looks like it was designed to latch shut but it doesn't. So if you accidentally knock over the box, be prepared to play 100 pushpin pick up. I just put a rubber band around the box and problem solved. Otherwise this product would have gotten a 5 star review."
Amazing but somehow familar,"Don't get me wrong, buy this album if you already haven't, it's better than most of what is out today in music, but when I first heard these guys back a few years ago when they first came out, I just couldn't get over the similarity they had to Jeff Buckley, which is something nobody mentions anymore because Coldplay has become so popular. I was almost angry that even though the lead singer admits that he (Jeff) was one of his biggest influences, they are still considered an ""original"" band. Although throughout time I have really grown to appriciate thier music and almost forget that they did rip off Jeff Buckley a fair bit, and now that Jeff has nothing more to offer us as he died an early death it's nice to hear something similar to him. But buy Jeff's album ""Grace"" if you like these guys. It's not easy listening, but worth every penny."
Wilderness Love,Good movie and very difficult for me to locate. Good acting and interesting to watch.
"Amazing poetry, horrible Kindle formatting","I already own a physical copy of this book. I wanted a digital edition for my Kindle and I bought one. What garbage, the formatting on the Kindle is done with such thoughtlessness and disregard that it should never have been released at all. I don't want to rate this 2 stars, the poetry deserves 5. Of course on Kindle you can't return anything you buy either, despite DRM preventing any illegal copying. Buy the physical book, but stay away from the Kindle edition."
Best Artist,"Tim Mcgraw is one of the best god damn artist out there.He got it all, Songs style and music skills.contenuing strong after years in music,and even given refrince in song from new and next up artist like Taylor Swift."
What's taking so long,I submitted a rather full review two weeks ago and it still hasn't been posted. What's the delay?
Waste of time!!!,This movie is horrid! We didn't even finish iended the torture after 20min and bought a different movie. Absolutely stinks!
"Was looking for a translation of the Tao Te Ching, not an interpretation","This is a long interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, not a simple straightforward translation. For a very clean, elegant and clear translation, I thoroughly recommend ""Tao Te Ching (Kindle Edition) by Burton Watson"" instead - seeTao Te Ching(Burton Watson translation for Kindle)"
Useless Item,Item was COMPLETELY useless. It would have produced similar results and would have been cheaper by using a magnifying glass and an ordinary light source like a lamp. It should not even have been in the market.
It's back in stock!,"Now I can give up trying to duplicate it! Just the right amount of heat, and it is a flavorful heat, not just a sting. Thick and satisfying, and easy to keep at the office. For me, there was not an artificial taste, I wonder if the other reviewer had an expired product. As far as shelf stable soups go, I thought it tasted a lot fresher than shelf stable grocery store stews and meals that are available by the boxed mac n cheese. A bit pricey, so only 4 stars, but if you are tired of bland and boring, this might be for you."
"Great idea, but some details...","I returned it. As another reviewer said, some of the illustrations are outright scary. My kids are used to Grimm's fairy tales, fables, and all, but I prefer leaving it to the limits of their imagination when it comes to scary pictures. Some of them were not only scary, but outright ugly. Wondering what the illustrator was thinking."
Mediocre mumbo-jumbo,"Today's reading: ""By renouncing samsara, we renounce our habitual grasping, unhappy minds. And by renouncing samsara, we embrace our potential for enlightenment."" Maybe I'm just too simple for this book, but I'm getting very little out of it. I've come across a few nuggets, but a lot of this is Greek to me. Not for the novice Buddhist or wisdom-seeker."
One of the Funniest Acts I've Ever Seen!!,Eddie Izzard has the gift of comedy. His style in this video is very playful. He gets the audience involved in his act and makes their response part of the joke. He has a lot of energy and there's a sort of mischeif in his facial expressions that keeps you watching to see what he'll do next. Eddie Izzard is one of my favorite comedians after viewing this performance.
Big Mistake,"I was really excited when I saw this in the store, so I bought it. It was a huge mistake. I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan and this was just terrible. The music was tacky and it was boring."
terrible!,The plastic is in bad quality.The boiled water smell like plastic!!!!so do not buy it.I have to return it.
Martha Argerich Evening Talks,"Fascinating conversation with a musical genius. Fabulous insider look at a rehearsal of the Schumann Piano Concerto. I treasure this DVD about an artist that heretofore has been very inaccessible.John McD. Wolff, MD"
not what i expected...,"Wow, I read this book and its' not what I expected. Yes I knew what it was about. But it's the explicit detail that the author gives everytime he is with one of his daughters. I personally DO NOT think he needs to be THAT specific to tell the story, and tell it well. It doesn't matter wheather incest is common, or misunderstood, whatever. I still think it's way to detailed. But, if you like that kinda thing, and like reading about incest, then buy the book. But I think anyone reading it is going to be shocked at first by the detail."
LAWRENCE WELD DVD,I purchased this DVD for an Alzheimer center. The clients there loved it and have watched it over and over. It is fun to watch their faces as they relive happier times.
Unfinished business,Didn't realize I had read this his until I was well into it ..finished it anyway .Another great Nora Roberts
I was quite impressed,"I tend to be a rather picky reader, and I can't stand poorly-written science fiction. There are a few gems out there. I love the subtlety (I didn't notice the play on words in the main character's name 'til nearly the end), the sense of humor, and the fact that the constructed world view didn't seem constructed; the book had a very down-to-earth, 'that's the way it is, period' outlook. The only problem I had with this book, and it wasn't enough to drop from 5 stars, was...what happened to Da5id?? Even a hokey 'happily-ever-after' would've sufficed in that respect. Ah well, over all an excellent book. I've just started Diamond Age..."
power boost trick doesn't work with new version (WAP11 v2.2),"An earlier review below talks about boosting the output power by playing with an undocumented setting. This only works for the old model. The new one, WAP11 v2.2, is completely different; there is no known way to make it output more power.--Pat / zippy at cs.brandeis.edu"
